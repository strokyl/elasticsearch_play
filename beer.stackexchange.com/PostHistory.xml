Ale yeasts are generally regarded as top-fermenting yeasts since they rise to the surface during fermentation, creating a very thick, rich yeast head. That is why the term &quot;top-fermenting&quot; is associated with ale yeasts. Fermentation by ale yeasts at these relatively warmer temperatures produces a beer high in esters, which many regard as a distinctive character of ale beers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Top-fermenting yeasts are used for brewing ales, porters, stouts, Altbier, Kölsch, and wheat beers. *&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Lager yeast strains are best used at temperatures ranging from 7 to 15°C. At these temperatures, lager yeasts grow less rapidly than ale yeasts, and with less surface foam they tend to settle out to the bottom of the fermenter as fermentation nears completion. This is why they are often referred to as &quot;bottom&quot; yeasts. The final flavour of the beer will depend a great deal on the strain of lager yeast and the temperatures at which it was fermented. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some of the lager styles made from bottom-fermenting yeasts are Pilsners, Dortmunders, Märzen, Bocks, and American malt liquors.* &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(all information from http://beeradvocate.com/)" />

(Technically you can re-carbonate flat beer!)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Natural carbonation - All beer has SOME yeast present. Home-brewers that bottle will actually pour a little bit of sugar into the racked beer before bottling. The yeast that is present will re-activate and eat the sugar. One of the bi-products is CO2. Because the beer is bottled and the CO2 has nowhere to go, it will dissolve into solution.

Prior to this point, each pub had mixed their own.  In addition to economies of scale, Harwood's method allowed for aging of the finished product.  Historians theorize that the name *porter* came about because of the porters who worked at the markets and delivered the final product to the pubs.  A variation of this theory suggests that *porter* simply refers to the working class occupations of those who drank the concoction.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another theory suggests that *porter* comes from the Netherlands, where a beer called *poorter* was being made as early as the 1300s.

For some time, working folk had been drinking a blend of beer, ale, and strong beer, which pubs would mix to balance out their stocks and maintain acceptable flavor.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Entire* was a pre-mixed version, brewed by Hardwood then sold and delivered to pubs.  Prior to this point, each pub had mixed their own.  In addition to economies of scale, Harwood's method allowed for aging of the finished product.  Historians theorize that the name *porter* came about because of the porters who worked at the markets and delivered the final product to the pubs.  A variation of this theory suggests that *porter* simply refers to the working class occupations of those who drank the concoction.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another theory suggests that *porter* comes from the Netherlands, where a beer called *poorter* was being made as early as the 1300s.  The Dutch were prolific traders, and cultural transfer could easily have occurred.  The term *poorter* originally concerned inhabitants of walled cities and may also have been related to social station.&#xD;&#xA;" />

I would guess this is primarily how it's done, but there could be other (post-fermentation) processes of removing alcohol.

I like many higher-alcohol beers because the alcohol seems to bring out many of the more complex flavours in the beer, making it (in my opinion) more interesting. That's not to say that all strong beers are good or all light beers are bad, as there are many other things to consider.

The first big distinction is ales versus lagers. Lagers are stored in cold rooms during the production process, and I find they're lighter on average than ales, certainly in terms of flavour, and often in terms of colour as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;After that, there are lots of less-black-and-white brewing differences between styles of beer. For example, IPAs generally have a considerable amount of hops added, but that's not always true. Hefeweizen has considerable amounts of yeast left after brewing, giving it its cloudy appearance. The list goes on and on.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Personally, I think that the traditional names for beer styles (stout, lager, IPA, wheat beer, etc.) are based a lot on brewing process, and in the case of something like lager or wheat beer, the name clearly shows the brewing origin. However, more and more brewers are pushing the boundaries of these styles, so when it comes to things like appearance and flavour, which are ultimately the things that matter, two beers from different brewing styles can be quite similar, or two beers from the same brewing style can be quite different." />

This [1953 analysis by a chemist in the Carlsberg research laboratory][1] has all the gory details.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Normal brewing yeast has enzymes that break down glucose and fructose, [but not lactose][2]. This kind of yeast evolved on rotting fruit, where there is plenty of sucrose, glucose, and fructose, but no lactose, so they never needed the enzymes. There are [other yeasts which can ferment lactose][3], but they aren't used in brewing, except by zany vodka makers and Mongols.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, in a normal beer, potentially all of the sugar can be broken down during brewing. Whether it is or not is up to the brewer, who can stop the process while sugar remains, or let it run to completion. However, in a milk stout, there is no way for the lactose to be broken down, so it all remains at the end.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The amount of lactose in a milk stout varies, but it seems that it is likely to be in the range of [5 to 13%][4]; that is, in a (568 millilitre) pint, there may be anywhere from 28 to 74 grams of lactose.

Popsci has a LOT of cool beer articles. Fractional freezing is the best way to increase the alcohol content of beer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Fractional freezing -- &quot;jacking&quot; in old parlance -- has a long history in the United States. The beverage applejack was produced using this method by first fermenting apple juice into hard apple cider. Then barrels of this cider were left outside during the winter and the connoisseur would occasionally fish out the frozen chunks of water, leaving an ever-concentrated batch of hard alcohol behind. At some point in the 20-25 percent ABV range, the liquor would stop freezing at ambient temperatures and the booze was ready to consume as &quot;Jersey Lightning.&quot; It was also used as currency.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Moving into the malt-beverage world, brewers in Germany use fractional freezing to make eisbock. These brews are usually just regular bock beers, which clock in at 6 percent ABV, freeze-concentrated to something in the 13 percent ABV range. Frankly, there are probably easier ways to get high-proof beers (make a barleywine, for example) than by starting with a mid-strength one and concentrating it, but there's a market for eisbocks and it's possible to find them in the US as well. A more infamous set of freeze-concentrated beers was made by the Scottish brewery BrewDog in their quest to make &quot;the strongest beer in the world.&quot; The first was Tactical Nuclear Penguin, a beer that started with an ABV in the teens and ended at 32 percent ABV. Then a little brewing war started up between BrewDog and German brewery Schorschbräu to make ever-stronger beers. Schorschbräu made a Schorschbock at 40 percent ABV, BrewDog countered with Sink the Bismarck at 41 percent ABV. Then came another beer at 55 percent ABV (that's 110 proof, my friends). Schorschbräu is current record-holder with Schorschbock 57, at 57 percent ABV.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Article][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-01/beersci-how-make-strong-beer-stronger" />

Just as a Chihuaua and a Great Dane are both *Canis Lupus*, a Galena Hop and a Goldings Hop are bot *Humulus Lupulus*, separated by vastly different lineages and genetics. New hop varieties are often developed by selective crossbreeding of existing variants, to generate different flavor profiles by adjusting the acidity and oil content of the hop.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Like different breeds of dogs, different hop varieties are often the products of hundreds of years of genetic development in a particular climate -  the Pacific Northwest, especially the Yakima Valley and Cascade Mountains in Washington, Oregon and Idaho, is known for it's production of very strong, highly acidic hops that impart a very strong bitter flavor - take a sip of a Sierra Nevada IPA and you'll instantly recognize that classic blend of the 'three C's'.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;By contrast, traditional hops grown in England and on the European continent tend to be more mellow and aromatic - especially the so called 'noble hops' popular in many less bitter tasting German and Czech beers. Still others, like Japans Sorachi Ace, offer a more citrus bite to the beer they're added to. While these differences are not *directly* a product of climate, it's doubtless true that climate has had an impact on the development of variation amongst the various hop lines that have been bred through the centuries -  and especially over the past 50 years or so.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Put another way: New World vs. Old World Hops is a meaningful distinction, but it has less to do with climate and more to do with the difference in cultivation practices and the specific varietals popular with farmers in various regions. Growing conditions may have some impact, but the specific lineage matters *much, much more*. The fact that those lineages tend to have significant geographic commonalities is as much an accident of history as it is of varying conditions, but it's nonetheless sufficiently meaningful that, in particular referring to hops from the Pacific Northwest evokes a very specific and comprehensible flavor profile in most educated beer drinkers." />

In general I find that aging tends to allow flavors to meld.  If I brew beer and do a brief aging in oak (or add oak chips), the beer usually *requires* aging to achieve balance.  This is most typical with something I sometimes make called ebulon (non-carbonated, fermented malt and elderberries, secondary fermentation in oak for a month, then bottled and aged for several more months).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Extrapolating from my experience here, I would expect a few general rules to apply:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1.  Beers with disparate sharp contrasts (particularly where fruit are involved) may benefit from aging.  I could imagine things like full-bodied apricot ales aging well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2.  Higher ABV and richer beers are likely to age better than lower ABV and lighter beers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is assuming you hope to see a general &quot;smoothing over&quot; of contrasts in an aged beer.  Some things will usually fade and some others may increase (for non-pasteurized or unfiltered beers, yeast flavors will usually increase)." />

Text="## tl;dr—We don't know (via science, at least).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Letting alone ethanol, which triggers innumerable biochemical pathways in our bodies, hops itself _may_ affect potency and sexual desire, in males at least, but there appears to be few clinical studies supporting this claim directly. Many articles online appear to have chained together several studies (or played news-telephone) to publish indirect conclusions, many of which oversimplify the effects of estrogen. For example, contrary to popular belief, it isn't _testosterone_ (alone) which masculinizes the male brain and behavior, but rather _its interaction with estrogen_, produced _from_ testosterone through a process known as aromatization.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; So it's not as simple as more-estrogen-less-sex-drive.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm certainly not qualified to deliver conclusions myself, but I can at least point to some of the important studies from which current (mis)conceptions have derived.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;1: [Wu, M. V. et al. Estrogen Masculinizes Neural Pathways and Sex-Specific Behaviors. 2009. [PDF]][1]&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Why some claim that hops decreases sex drive...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hops contains phytoestrogens,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; substances that promote estrogenic actions in mammals and structurally are similar to mammalian estrogen 17&amp;beta;-estradiol (E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) [...]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;[Ososki, A. L. and Kennelly, E. J. Phytoestrogens: a Review of the Present State of Research. 2003. [PDF]][2]&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Specifically,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; a recurring suggestion has been that hops have a powerful estrogenic activity and that beer may also be estrogenic. [...] We have identified a potent phytoestrogen in hops, 8-prenylnaringenin, which has an activity greater than other established plant estrogens.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;[Milligan, S. R. et al. Identification of a potent phytoestrogen in hops (_Humulus lupulus_ L.) and beer. 1999. [PDF]][3]&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, it's worth noting that the same paper concludes,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [...] despite the high estrogenic activity of 8-prenylnarigenin, the total estrogenic activity of beer made using whole hops is still low [...] and no detrimental health effects due to &quot;estrogens in beer&quot; are to be expected.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Anyway, another study led by the same researcher delved into the mechanism of action:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 8-Prenylnaringenin alone competed strongly with 17&amp;beta;-estradiol for binding to both the &amp;alpha;- and &amp;beta;-estrogen receptors.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;[Milligan, S. R. et al. The endocrine activities of 8-prenylnargingenin and related hop (_Humulus lupulus_ L.) flavonoids. 2000. [PDF]][4]&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(In case one is unfamiliar with how receptors work, receptors &quot;catch&quot; freestanding compounds in a medium such as the bloodstream, thereby reducing their effects. The phytoestrogen in hops appears to get itself &quot;caught&quot; by estrogen receptors, thereby blocking those receptors from catching estrogen it'd normally catch, thereby leaving higher levels of estrogen in the bloodstream.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## ...but it's not that simple!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Again, from these findings alone, conclusions about male potency and sex drive can't be so easily drawn. Hormone interactions are sufficiently complex that researchers are still trying to untangle, isolate, and explain ever-more-specific biochemical pathways. Certainly the average Joe (or journalist) wouldn't be capable of appreciating the magnitude (or triviality) of the effects of biochemical pathways described in researchers' findings, much less draw definitive conclusions about physiological effects like &quot;potency,&quot; &quot;sex drive,&quot; and how it all affects, say, muscle-building. Not to mention all the other chemicals in play!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As a very example of the latter, one site [[link](http://www.peaktestosterone.com/Testosterone_Beer.aspx)] (which, unfortunately, ranks high among Google search results) is clearly biased, grasping for evidence to &quot;prove&quot; that beer has detrimental effects on testosterone activity. I'm not saying beer _doesn't_, but their article states that Xanthohumol, another compound found in hops, &quot;blocks testosterone,&quot; when in fact _the very paper it cites_ says (in its abstract nonetheless),&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Although hops is commonly linked with phytoestrogenic effects, we identified XN [Xanthohumol] as a pure estrogen antogonist. Interestingly, XN may also reduce the generation of estrogens by inhibition of the enzymatic activity of aromatase, which converts testosterone to estrogen. Anti-estrogenic effects of XN [...] were confirmed in vivo in an uterotrophy assay with prepubertal rats.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;[Strathmann, J. et al. Xanthohumol from Hops Prevents Hormone-Dependent Tumourigenesis In Vitro and In Vivo. 2008. [PDF]][5]&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On top of all this, ethanol affects so many parts of the brain via so many chemical pathways—what's even the significance of 8-prenylnarigenin or Xanthohumol when stacked against ethanol? Do you know?—I sure don't—and probably no one does—else it'd have been stated by researchers themselves, without the &quot;help&quot; of attention-seeking bloggers and headline-hunting journalists.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## In conclusion,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm not saying these blogs, articles, and threads are necessarily _wrong_—they might be right, whether right-by-chance, or right-by-empiricism (observation). What I _am_ saying is that they can't be _right-by-science_, as currently available research seems extremely domain-specific, incomplete in larger perspectives, and therefore not generalizable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://shahlab.ucsf.edu/papers/paper14.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.comilac.com.tr/uploads/pdf/22ComFUGA.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://press.endocrine.org/doi/pdf/10.1210/jcem.84.6.5887&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://press.endocrine.org/doi/pdf/10.1210/jcem.85.12.7168&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://www.dkfz.de/en/tox/download/gerh/pdf-files/Proc.-2nd-Humulus-Symposium-2009.pdf" />

The other is the use of Brettanomyces yeast during this same maturation, which are a local wild yeast. Hallertau, Styrian Goldings and French Strisselspalt hops are used. The beer is then matured at 15°C for a minimum of four weeks on site before being distributed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If drunk right after bottling it has a &quot;young&quot; fresh flavor. The beer can be preserved for several years as it re-ferments once bottled. Even 35 year old Orval is still drinkable, if preserved at the right temperature. After about 1 year of preservation the beer flavor changes to a softer, sweeter and more intense experience compared to the young one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are two versions of Orval, one is the normal one which can be bought in the stores and then there is also a special *Petite Orval*, which can only be drunk at the Orval abbey and is only produced for the Monks (no mass sale). Its alcohol percentage is a lot lower than the normal Orval. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/bNvYJ.jpg" />

Firstly, there's the added production cost in the bottled or canned product: the widget.  Secondly, I would wager that most breweries want the product to taste similar on draught as in a can or bottle, and it's very uncommon to have nitrogen available in a taproom.  (You can get special taps which &quot;cream&quot; the beer on the way out, but again, for consistency those would have to be installed where-ever you sell your beer.)

Both chronic and acute alcohol consumption have been shown in most (but not all) studies to inhibit testosterone production in the testes. This is believed to be caused by the metabolism of alcohol reducing the NAD+/NADH ratio both in the liver and the testes; since the synthesis of testosterone requires NAD+, this tends to reduce testosterone production.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; As testosterone is critical for libido and physical arousal, alcohol tends to have deleterious effects on male sexual performance. Studies have been conducted that indicate increasing levels of alcohol intoxication produce a significant degradation in male masturbatory effectiveness (MME). This degradation was measured by measuring blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and ejaculation latency. Alcohol intoxication can decrease sexual arousal, decrease pleasureability and intensity of orgasm, and increase difficulty in attaining orgasm.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since wikipedia show related soruce of that info and most of them are clinical research, we can say that alcohol have a negative effect on men.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;In many women, alcohol increases sexual arousal and desire, although it does lower the physiological signs of arousal. Women have a different response to alcohol intoxication. Studies have shown that acute alcohol consumption tends to cause increased levels of testosterone and estradiol. Since testosterone controls in part the strength of libido in women, this tends to cause an increase in interest in sex. Also, because women have a higher percentage of body fat and less water in their bodies, alcohol can have a quicker, more severe impact. Women’s bodies take longer to process alcohol; more precisely, a woman's body often takes one-third longer to eliminate the substance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Sexual behavior in women under the influence of alcohol is also different from men. Studies have shown that increased BAC is associated with longer orgasmic latencies and decreased intensity of orgasm. Some women report a greater sexual arousal with increased alcohol consumption as well as increased sensations of pleasure during orgasm. Because ejaculatory response is visual and can more easily be measured in males, orgasmic response must be measured more intimately. In studies of the female orgasm under the influence of alcohol, orgasmic latencies were measured using a vaginal photoplethysmograph, which essentially measures vaginal blood volume.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Different from men, we can say alcohol have more pros beside few cons for women.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Beer and couples&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Men&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Beer is probably the least powerful aphrodisiac alcoholic drink. The alcohol percentage in beer is low, meaning that more liquid has to be consumed to raise men's testosterone levels to hit that &quot;comfortable&quot; level. Most beers are very nourishing and filling, and when too many of them are consumed, they can create an unpleasant stomachache. Drinking too much beer will make men go to the washroom more often, as well as create a bloating sensation. The effects of being bloated surely don't entice sexual encounters and won't lead men to seek out sexual opportunities. Yet, some special beers have a local reputation for increasing libido, but even with that, beer is not the best choice for men.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Women&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While hops in beer will have a negative impact on men’s hormonal balance, it may actually be positive for women. Hops has aphrodisiac-like qualities for women, as because of the phytoestrogen it contains, which mimic natural estrogen. Low sex drive in women is often cause by low levels of estrogen.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Consuming beer, especially hop-rich varieties like IPA, could actually help restore hormonal balance and help with libido and also alleviate menopausal symptoms of fatigue, irritability and hot flashes&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_and_sex#Alcohol_and_sex_in_men" />

You find it in the new world with drinks like chicha (an Andean drink where saliva provides the amylase to break down corn starch into sugars for fermentation), among Native Americans in North America as well, in early Europe, in early China, and early Japan as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Grain fermenting is a remarkably complex process because yeast can't digest starch so you have to have some way of turning starches into sugars.  These break down into more or less three strategies:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1.  malting (roasting sprouted grains).  Interestingly doesn't work for rice.&#xD;&#xA;2.  helper cultures, like they use to make sake.  Add a fungus that breaks down starch and then a yeast to eat the sugar.  Indonesian &quot;Tape&quot; (rice or cassava &quot;beer&quot; or paste) is done this way as is Chinese rice beer and wine.  As a bonus this also works on other starches, like yams (used in Malaysia).&#xD;&#xA;3.  Chewing the grains to mix with saliva and then spitting in a bowl as with the Andean Chicha drink.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;South America has all three methods represented, as does early Asia.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The fact that different strategies are employed around the world suggests to my mind that brewing did not start somewhere and spread but was independently reinvented in different places.  It is probably for this reason extremely old, far older than we have direct evidence for.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for beer, the question becomes what you mean.  If you mean fermented grains, we have no idea.  It's very very old and might go back to neolithic times if not even earlier (though I suspect that the organized grain agriculture of neolithic times was an absolute prerequisite to grain fermentation).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you mean malt, yeast, and hops, we still don't know.  We have evidence that hops was cultivated for beer in Augustine's time, and Old Norse distinguishes between beer and ale by the use of hops but Old English &quot;beor&quot; means something different (probably very strong mead with herbs?), suggesting perhaps that the hops distinction post-dated the split of Old Norse (and thus 8th century), but that doesn't get you very far.  What is pretty clear is that it certainly predates our earliest records of the practice.  By how much and when did it become a separate drink?  I don't think we will ever know.  At any rate the early prevalence of hops as one herb used in brewing among many in early England and Scandinavia suggests (though does not prove) that hops were adopted (again as one herb among any) for beer brewing by the Germanic tribes, some time before we have written records.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now as for lager, these are far more recent.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally as a note, until maybe a hundred years ago, before modern capping and beer cans, most beer would have been sold uncarbonated, but speciality beers were carbonated much like champagne is today.  My own home brewing experiments (I even brew as a history nut) with non-carbonated beers suggest that they are of an altogether different character than carbonated ones (owing to the carbonic acid in carbonated drinks).  The flavors are lighter, sweeter, brighter, and more distinct, and entirely different than &quot;flat&quot; beer.  This is because dissolved carbon dioxide imparts extra acidity to beer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**EDIT**:  It also occurs to me that controlled fermentation is one of the most common ways of preserving foods in the pre-industrial ages.  This includes lactic fermentation (that gives us shelf-stable cheese, salami, sauerkraut, etc), but also alcoholic fermentation must be included there too.  There's no reason to think that the first fermented grains were fermented by accident." />

Some kegs have a pressure relief valve that can be pulled to reduce pressure. But do it in small bursts, and try the beer after each until you see that the beer comes out not to quickly.&#xD;&#xA; 2. increase the resistance outside the keg by using a longer beer line and/or placing the keg somewhere low and serving the beer higher. (e.g. keg at ground level and stand up to serve the beer.)&#xD;&#xA; 3. dispense a large amount beer to a large jug - removing beer from the keg will reduce the pressure in the keg, and keeping it in a jug gives time for the head on the beer to settle down.

They might be chilled or not, but they would have been entirely uncarbonated, shipped in wooden barrels, etc. and had an altogether different flavor and character than our modern beers.  My experience playing with these concepts as a homebrewer suggests that such beers were better suited to being served warm than comparably dark carbonated beers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To understand why, I think you have to look at carbonation and how temperature affects that.  Carbon dioxide is more soluble in cold water than warm water, so the warmer the beer is, the faster it goes flat, and the more it fizzes when opened.  So you have two ways carbonation affects the picture.  First it impacts the taste and serving conditions differently at different temperatures, and secondly it imparts a distinctive off-tang when the beer goes flat.  Temperature helps offset the latter to a mild extent but at the expense of the former.  I think this also helps explain why richer beers are more often served warm than lighter beers." />

The smoky bacon flavor comes both from the actual inclusion of bacon and from the smoked malt: *Briess Cherrywood Smoked Malt, Weyermann Beechwood Smoked Malt, House-smoked Hickory Malt*.  As discussed in http://beer.stackexchange.com/questions/53/does-chocolate-stout-contain-real-chocolate/65#65, certain flavors can be achieved through the malting process rather than through additional ingredients.  Similarly maple is fermentable and could be added directly to boost alcohol content and impart a more subtle maple flavor.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, this beer does contain actual bacon and &quot;maple flavor&quot;.  To get a look at and when and how the flavors are added, we can look at [this clone recipe](http://www.brewtoad.com/recipes/inspired-by-rogue-voodoo-doughnut-maple-bacon-ale). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    Name              Amount     Time        Use&#xD;&#xA;    Fenugreek         0.25 oz    5.0 min     Boil&#xD;&#xA;    Maple Extract     1.0 oz     6.0 days    Primary&#xD;&#xA;    Bacon, cooked     4.0 oz     0.0 days    Bottle&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here, fenugreek is added during the boil phase, while creating the wort.  The boiling helps extract the flavor from the herb.  Maple extract gets added later during fermentation.  Maple extract or syrup could be used, but syrup is more expensive and fermentable so a stronger maple flavor is being achieved with extract.  The official ingredient list calls for &quot;Pure Maple Flavoring&quot; so I assume the same is being done there.  Lastly the bacon is being added at the end.  This is to add direct flavoring to the beer without interfering in the fermentation process." />

Heavy, high starch beers, have long been used as a food source for fasting monks, sort of a liquid bread.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3.  Beer is commonly used for cooking certain things because the alcohol (as with wine) helps bring out certain flavors.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Additionally I want to mention something I use it for.  This works for me because of very specific reasons and **I am not recommending that anyone else try it.**  However, I get asthma frequently following upper respiratory illnesses (I have since I was a teenager).  I have a couple of alternative medical strategies for dealing with this depending on what is available.  Note, if you have asthma, don't take medical advice from me: asthma can be life threatening.  Work with a doctor.   However, among other things, I find that drinking a number of drinks of beer or wine for two nights in a row will cause the asthma to clear up until I get sick again.  This naturally works best when I am not otherwise consuming alcohol, but it allows me to be mostly medication free regarding my asthma (doing this two to three times a year).  Again this has a bunch of risks, so I am mentioning it just for informational purposes.  In general anything medical deserves a great deal of respect because what can cure can kill.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also some kinds of traditional beer have very specific health benefits.  In Indonesia, &quot;tape hitam&quot; (black rice beer, consumed with the lees as a sort of soup) is generally understood to reduce blood cholesterol.

It's similar in&#xD;&#xA;   principle to the fluted champagne glass, but having larger rim,&#xD;&#xA;   affords larger sips.&#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA; - The traditional mug is a robust glass, primarly aimed at &quot;chinking&quot;&#xD;&#xA;   glasses together and allowing large swallows of beer. &#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA; - The challace/goblet can be beautiful pieces of work, designed to&#xD;&#xA;   showcase the beer, and also promote and maintain a large head. &#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA; - The tulip glass captures volatiles (in the narrow part of the glass)&#xD;&#xA;   while the large opening at the top supports a large head.&#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA; - The Sniffer, typically used for cognac/brandy, but also for very&#xD;&#xA;   strong ales, has a large base that curves up to a small opening to&#xD;&#xA;   capture the aromatics, and to allow for swirling to encourage more&#xD;&#xA;   aromatics to be released.&#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA; - The Stange, a long tall glass, amplifies the malt and hop&#xD;&#xA;   characteristics by concentrating them in a smaller area, while also&#xD;&#xA;   providing a simple elegant presentation of the beer. Often used with&#xD;&#xA;   delicate beers.&#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA; - The Weizen glass is similar to the pilsner glass, but larger&#xD;&#xA;   (typically 0.5l minimum) with plenty of room for the large head&#xD;&#xA;   typical of a wheat beer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For more details and images, see http://beeradvocate.com/beer/101/glassware/" />

In the Middle Ages?  Where?  When?  These are important questions.  Lumping around a thousand years and very different cultural eras (ranging from the Vendell-era Norse to the Byzantine Empire) into the same label is problematic at the very least.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The answer I think to the question as stated has to be &quot;no&quot; insofar as there were times and places in the Middle Ages where beer was a clear luxury (early medieval Iceland comes to mind).  Similarly, it isn't always clear that beer was universally consumed by the lower classes in much of the Middle Ages (though certainly towards the end it became more common).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This being said, beer was an important dietary staple in much (though not all!) of medieval Europe at least among monks, merchants, and the upper classes.  Heavier beers were used as bread substitutes.  For the common man in Anglo-Saxon England, though, even bread was a luxury  and most grains were cooked into gruel, porridge, either with or without fracturing (think of bulgur wheat).  This would then be supplemented with vegetables, eggs, dairy, and sometimes meat (even for the serfs, at least in Anglo-Saxon England, meat was not out of the question).  Well water was the primary source of hydration in this era (again see Hagen, below), and laws were passed to ensure that drinking water directly from someone else's well was protected, legal activity (in other words, a well owner could restrict what people could take away from the well, but not what they could drink on the spot).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If we separate out the lower classes and the areas where beer was not commonly available (Iceland, for example) the picture changes dramatically.  Beer was very common, but not at all a homogeneous beverage.  Bald's Leechbook (10th Century, Anglo-Saxon) contains the warning that while &quot;ealu&quot; (-&gt; ale) may be consumed by pregnant women, &quot;beor&quot; (-&gt; beer) causes miscarriage.  Identifying these beverages is problematic. Ann Hagen (&quot;Anglo-Saxon Food and Drink&quot;) suggests that &quot;beor&quot; must have been a strong mead instead of a malt liquor based on descriptions of specific gravity (she calculates a minimum alcohol content of around 20%).  If it was a strong mead, it may have been further supplemented by herbs like mugwort, henbane, and hops, and therefore even more problematic than a strong mead might be.  In this case, it would have been fermented grains would have been certainly consumed by children and pregnant women.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Interestingly the traditional fermented rice and cassava dishes here in Indonesia are acceptable to serve to children too.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sources on history:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1.

The beer may be perfectly drinkable, but be marked down because it doesn't fit with the style. For example, a hefeweizen that is dark would be lose points for appearance since they are light-colored beers by style.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Judging sheets often have a list of flavor descriptors. Some flavors are bad for any beer, such as rubber, astringent, soapy, while others may or may not be considered faults depending upon style. For example, fruitiness in an English Ale is much desired, but not in a Pilsner, similarly low levels of diacetyl in a Stout is acceptable, but not in a Hefeweizen.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The [BJCP Scoresheet][1] provides a working example of the notes a beer judge&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.bjcp.org/docs/SCP_BeerScoreSheet.pdf" />

In the Middle Ages?  Where?  When?  These are important questions.  Lumping around a thousand years and very different cultural eras (ranging from the Vendell-era Norse to the Byzantine Empire) into the same label is problematic at the very least.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The answer I think to the question as stated has to be &quot;no&quot; insofar as there were times and places in the Middle Ages where beer was a clear luxury (early medieval Iceland comes to mind).  Similarly, it isn't always clear that beer was universally consumed by the lower classes in much of the Middle Ages (though certainly towards the end it became more common).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Example 1:  Anglo-Saxon England&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This being said, beer was an important dietary staple in much (though not all!) of medieval Europe at least among monks, merchants, and the upper classes.  Heavier beers were used as bread substitutes.  For the common man in Anglo-Saxon England, though, even bread was a luxury  and most grains were cooked into gruel, porridge, either with or without fracturing (think of bulgur wheat).  This would then be supplemented with vegetables, eggs, dairy, and sometimes meat (even for the serfs, at least in Anglo-Saxon England, meat was not out of the question).  Well water was the primary source of hydration in this era (again see Hagen, below), and laws were passed to ensure that drinking water directly from someone else's well was protected, legal activity (in other words, a well owner could restrict what people could take away from the well, but not what they could drink on the spot).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If we separate out the lower classes and the areas where beer was not commonly available (Iceland, for example) the picture changes dramatically.  Beer was very common, but not at all a homogeneous beverage.  Bald's Leechbook (10th Century, Anglo-Saxon) contains the warning that while &quot;ealu&quot; (-&gt; ale) may be consumed by pregnant women, &quot;beor&quot; (-&gt; beer) causes miscarriage.  Identifying these beverages is problematic. Ann Hagen (&quot;Anglo-Saxon Food and Drink&quot;) suggests that &quot;beor&quot; must have been a strong mead instead of a malt liquor based on descriptions of specific gravity (she calculates a minimum alcohol content of around 20%).  If it was a strong mead, it may have been further supplemented by herbs like mugwort, henbane, and hops, and therefore even more problematic than a strong mead might be.  In this case, it would have been fermented grains would have been certainly consumed by children and pregnant women.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Interestingly the traditional fermented rice and cassava dishes here in Indonesia are acceptable to serve to children too.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sources on history:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1.  Hagen, Ann.  &quot;Anglo-Saxon Food and Drink&quot;&#xD;&#xA;2.  Pollington, Stephen.  &quot;Leechcraft&quot; (for an edition of Bald's Leechbook with facing page translation).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Example 2:  Medieval Iceland&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The early Icelandic settlers tried to grow barley for beer with only very limited success.  Alcoholic beverages were thus very much a luxury item, and usually if someone was going to have it (going mostly by medieval saga evidence as ethnography), it was going to be someone who had gone viking and returned with a fair bit of wealth.  A second point though is that Icelandic society recognized about three levels of society (godhi, bondi, and thrall) based on relationship to certain kinds of property:  a godhi (priest-attorney-legislator-jurist) owned a godhord (the office was property and could be sold, loaned, or even put into partnership property).  A bondi (free juryman) owned land.  And a thrall was owned (though the actual requirements would have been more like early serfdom than slavery due to a lack of central administration and enforcement).  In addition to successful bondi-turned-vikings, you would have had the fact that a godhi had sufficient economic benefits from office to likely be able to afford alcoholic beverages at least sometimes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In Iceland, drinking was usually a social action and as far as the existing evidence goes would have been a specifically male activity limited to the sorts of ritualized drinking portrayed in Beowulf (such ritualized drinking is portrayed in the Volsung Saga, Egill's Saga, Njall's Saga, and many many others).  Drunkenness was warned against in the literature, and there are very interesting questions of what else was put in the beverages, since poisoning was a pretty clear concern in the literature (Eddic poems such as Havamal and Sigdrifumal speak to both these concerns).  From archaeological evidence from &quot;continental&quot; Scandinavia, we may surmise henbane was common, and this may to some extent play into the references to military drinking in Hrolf Kraki's Saga.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In short, in Iceland, as far as we can tell, beer and mead would have been limited to far more ritualized roles (reinforcing social obligations, certain forms of oaths, etc).  Literature on women and alcohol is very sparse.  It's probable that the bride drank at the wedding as part of making the wedding official.  There's a lot of uncertainty beyond this however in terms of attitudes towards pregnancy and alcohol.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Further reading:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* the various sagas referenced above.&#xD;&#xA;* The Poetic Edda (I usually recommend the Hollander translation if you are going to work in translation because he tends to be transparent about which emendations he is using).&#xD;&#xA;* Byock, Jesse:  Viking-Age Iceland&#xD;&#xA;* Byock, Jesse:  Medieval Iceland&#xD;&#xA;* Roesdahl, Else: The Vikings&#xD;&#xA;* Pollington, Stephen: Leechcraft (for some archaeological discussions of Scandinavian forts and brewing)." />

By contrasting beers side-by-side, we build an _internal_, as-of-yet-wordless &quot;vocabulary&quot; of tastes, _e.g_ &quot;This beer has more of... _that thing_, whatever it's called, than this one,&quot; and _then_ we learn terminology (and ingredients and processes) as a means of filling those voids in words for senses we've experienced. Otherwise, we're storing abstract definitions, which we don't retain very well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/9elD1.png" />

What you want is a good *experience*, and taste is only a part (albeit a major part) of that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Having different glasses for different types of beers can affect your drinking experience in a number of different ways. First off, having an unusual or unique glass can often be very fun, because it's probably not something you're used to. The first time I ever drank beer from a litre mug was a very fun experience for me, and not because it made the beer taste differently. Secondly, I find that different types of glasses encourage me to enjoy beer in different ways. I find that glasses with stems, which are often used for stronger beers, encourage me to drink the beer more slowly and savour it a bit more than a glass without a stem. I think these effects on experience are one of the big reasons for the wide variations in beer glassware. As a beer manufacturer, if I could make a unique glass that will better help people remember my beer, I would consider that a worthwhile investment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm not trying to say that the effects of glassware on taste don't exist or are unimportant; I think they are important.

Many articles online appear to have chained together several studies (or played news-telephone) to publish indirect conclusions, many of which oversimplify the effects of estrogen. For example, contrary to popular belief, it isn't _testosterone_ (alone) which masculinizes the male brain and behavior, but rather _its interaction with estrogen_, produced _from_ testosterone through a process known as aromatization.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; So it's not as simple as more-estrogen-less-sex-drive.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm certainly not qualified to deliver conclusions myself, but I can at least point to some of the important studies from which current (mis)conceptions have derived.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;1: [Wu, M.

[...] We have identified a potent phytoestrogen in hops, 8-prenylnaringenin, which has an activity greater than other established plant estrogens.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;[Milligan, S. R. et al. Identification of a potent phytoestrogen in hops (_Humulus lupulus_ L.) and beer. 1999. [PDF]][3]&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, it's worth noting that the same paper concludes,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [...] despite the high estrogenic activity of 8-prenylnarigenin, the total estrogenic activity of beer made using whole hops is still low [...] and no detrimental health effects due to &quot;estrogens in beer&quot; are to be expected.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Anyway, another study led by the same researcher delved into the mechanism of action:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 8-Prenylnaringenin alone competed strongly with 17&amp;beta;-estradiol for binding to both the &amp;alpha;- and &amp;beta;-estrogen receptors.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;[Milligan, S. R. et al. The endocrine activities of 8-prenylnargingenin and related hop (_Humulus lupulus_ L.) flavonoids. 2000.

The phytoestrogen in hops appears to get itself &quot;caught&quot; by estrogen receptors, thereby blocking those receptors from catching estrogen it'd normally catch, thereby leaving higher levels of estrogen in the bloodstream.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## ...but it's not that simple!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Again, from these findings alone, conclusions about male potency and sex drive can't be so easily drawn. Hormone interactions are sufficiently complex that researchers are still trying to untangle, isolate, and explain ever-more-specific biochemical pathways. Certainly the average Joe (or journalist) wouldn't be capable of appreciating the magnitude (or triviality) of the effects of biochemical pathways described in researchers' findings, much less draw definitive conclusions about physiological effects like &quot;potency,&quot; &quot;sex drive,&quot; and how it all affects, say, muscle-building. Not to mention all the other chemicals in play!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As a very example of the latter, one site [[link](http://www.peaktestosterone.com/Testosterone_Beer.aspx)] (which, unfortunately, ranks high among Google search results) is clearly biased, grasping for evidence to &quot;prove&quot; that beer has detrimental effects on testosterone activity. I'm not saying beer _doesn't_, but their article states that Xanthohumol, another compound found in hops, &quot;blocks testosterone,&quot; when in fact _the very paper it cites_ says (in its abstract nonetheless),&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Although hops is commonly linked with phytoestrogenic effects, we identified XN [Xanthohumol] as a pure estrogen antogonist. Interestingly, XN may also reduce the generation of estrogens by inhibition of the enzymatic activity of aromatase, which converts testosterone to estrogen. Anti-estrogenic effects of XN [...] were confirmed in vivo in an uterotrophy assay with prepubertal rats.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;[Strathmann, J. et al.

Do you know?—I sure don't—and probably no one does—else it'd have been stated by researchers themselves, without the &quot;help&quot; of attention-seeking bloggers and headline-hunting journalists.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## In conclusion,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm not saying these blogs, articles, and threads are necessarily _wrong_—they might be right, whether right-by-chance, or right-by-empiricism (observation).

Since the keg is kept at room temperature, if the beer is unpasteurized the flavor will evolve at a faster rate than refrigerated beer would.  This isn't a change due to the quick cooling, per se, but it is a possibly major difference.&#xD;&#xA; 2. As mentioned by @acheong, the CO2 solubility of beer is significantly lower at room temperature, so keeping the beer properly carbonated becomes a more difficult task.  Specifically, you have to keep the pressure much higher, making the serving pressure higher, which makes the complex calculus of draft line measurements that much harder.&#xD;&#xA; 3. Chill haze could be an issue.  If the brewer didn't take steps to prevent it, there'll be haze-inducing proteins in suspension.  If the beer is stored cool, these will quickly fall out, but if it's kept warm and only cooled at the time it's served, they'll end up in your glass." />

Could be fun, though.  :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most commercial beer is *force-carbonated*.  That is to say, the beer is produced and ready to drink (minus the fizz) before they put it in the bottle and mechanically carbonate the beer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Beer that is *bottle-conditioned* or *bottle-fermented*, however, is put into a bottle with some extra sugar.  The beer is intentionally left with a little of the yeast from the fermentation process, and is sealed with the sugar.  The yeast then does it's normal thing: it eats the sugar and excretes alcohol plus carbon-dioxide.  Since the bottle is sealed, the CO2 has nowhere to go, so it goes into dissolution in the beer, giving you that fizz.  Most bottled homebrew will be like this.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, if you have a beer that is both flat and was bottle-conditioned (and therefore still has some yeast in it), you might be able to bottle-ferment it again:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Add a very small amount of sugar to the bottle.  Table sugar works, although corn sugar (which you can find from a brew store) is ideal.  It'll be really hard to get the right amount (about 0.083 oz), so I recommend pre-measured tablets of the stuff: http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/munton-s-carb-tabs.html&#xD;&#xA;2. Seal the bottle somehow.  If you have a [bottle-capper](http://www.amazon.com/Bottle-Capper-Red-Baron-Homebrew/dp/B000Q6ARMY) and some caps, that'd be ideal.  Otherwise, you might be able to get by with a soda bottle and cap.

Wait a week, maybe a couple to be sure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you're lucky, there's enough viable yeast in the bottle to start acting again (now that it has new sugar to eat), which will create more CO2 and recarbonate the bottle." />

The original gravity of the beer (gravity measure the amount of sugar in the wort), the type and strain of yeast used, and alcohol content of the finished beer.  Other factors such as any adjuncts used in the beer can affect this as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, a low gravity, low alcohol ale using an efficient yeast strain can be ready to drink in as little as 10 days.  However a heavy lager beer can take 2-3 months to complete and some Belgian yeast strains can take several weeks to complete fermentation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some beers go through additional conditioning post-fermentation before they are at their prime to drink.  This conditioning may include simple bottle conditioning or barrel-aging to impart different flavors.  There are some barrel-ages stout beers that have taken 18+ months to complete the process before the brewer feels they are ready to serve." />

According to it, the suggested pairing for an IPA is&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Strong, spicy food (classic with curry!); bold, sweet desserts like carrot cake&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;and for a Double/Imperial IPA is&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Smoked beef brisket, grilled lamb; Southern chicken-fried steak.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I found a great little [summary by Michael Agnew (2012)](http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2012/03/what-to-eat-with-ipa-india-pale-ale-food-pairings.html) that explains some of the rationale behind these pairings (emphasis mine hereon):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; When pairing IPA with food you have three basic flavor hooks at your disposal; bitterness, hop flavor (spicy, grassy, herbal, earthy, and citrus), and caramel. Hop flavors have a great affinity for spices and light fruits. Bitterness has a cooling affect. Paired with **spicy dishes**, IPA will fan the flames at first, but douse them in the end. Bitterness also amplifies **salty and umami flavors**. The caramel flavors in the beer will latch onto the sweeter side of a dish, tying into things like **caramelized onion** or the crispy skins of roast poultry. And the hop acids and carbonation make IPAs **great palate cleansers** to take on even the fattiest deep-fried delights.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Samuel Adams has a &quot;Pair with Sam&quot; tool, and looking at its [suggested pairings for their Whitewater IPA](http://www.samueladams.com/food-and-craft-beer/pair-with-sam?beer-name=whitewater-ipa&amp;beerid=7abae512-5798-4f59-bd3e-98698adcd1bf) (hoppier than their Latitude 48 IPA), **pork appears to be the meat of choice: pulled pork, barbeque ribs, chorizo, roasted pork tenderloin, and sweet sausage**; and the rest of its suggestions align with the salty-and-spicy pattern we've  seen.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We seem to have found strong consensus already, but just one more to make sure. In [Blue Point Brewing Company's words](http://bluepointbrewing.com/bpbc/food-pairings/guide-to-pairing/), its IPA pairings are meant to complement&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; intensely flavorful, highly spiced dishes, such as curry, and bold, sweet desserts like flourless chocolate cake and crème brulée&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;or&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; rich, aromatic, spicy and smoked foods such as chili, BBQ ribs, grilled chicken, and beef.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Actually, I think they stole those words from Wegmans' [Guide to Beer and Food Pairing](http://www.wegmans.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?productId=667885&amp;storeId=10052)." />

It is believed that these farmhouse beers would have been of a lower abv than modern saisons - probably initially around 3 to 3.5% abv on average, rising in the early 20th century to between 4.5 and 6.5% abv.

I've got a big dog (Neapolitan Mastiff) though, so my package carriers usually just sign for me and run for the hills when they have the displeasure of delivering something to my house haha. So I'm not sure if they'd bother checking my ID if I ever bought beer online. I'm perfectly legal drinking age though, so it doesn't matter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With that said, you'd probably be best off looking through your local laws and maybe start a petition to have it legalized. I don't think its in the best interests of this community to be discussing loopholes in the law (despite how much I hate the government). I say start a petition, maybe it'll become a proposition and be placed on the ballot come election day. The only other option would be to have it shipped to another address in a border state if you live near the border. No online beer distributor is going to violate the law or tamper with it to make a buck, there's too much liability; they could lose their license and be put out of business." />

The compression and expansion causes agitation which foams up the beer. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Tell me more...&#xD;&#xA;---------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The layman's summary from [Scientists discover why beer bottles overflow after a sudden impact][1]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; A lot happens in the short period of time between tap and torrent. The&#xD;&#xA;&gt; moment some jerk clocks your bottle's mouth, a compression wave&#xD;&#xA;&gt; travels down through the glass. When the wave hits bottom, it's&#xD;&#xA;&gt; reflected as an expansion wave that travels through the beer. These&#xD;&#xA;&gt; waves keep bouncing back and forth, with the compression waves&#xD;&#xA;&gt; breaking up the CO2 bubbles in your beer into thousands of incredibly&#xD;&#xA;&gt; tiny microbubbles, and the expansion waves causing those microbubbles&#xD;&#xA;&gt; to violently expand into skyrocketing plumes.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; The result? Millions and millions of expanding CO2 bubbles turn your&#xD;&#xA;&gt; beer into foam shooting out of your bottle. With any luck, it spills&#xD;&#xA;&gt; all over your jerk friend's pants.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The abstract from the [published article][2]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; A sudden vertical impact on the mouth of a beer bottle generates a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; compression wave that propagates through the glass towards the bottom.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; When this wave reaches the base of the bottle, it is transmitted to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the liquid as an expansion wave that travels to free surface, where it&#xD;&#xA;&gt; bounces back as a compression wave. This train of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; expansion-compression waves drives the forced cavitation of existing&#xD;&#xA;&gt; air pockets, leading to their violent collapse. A cloud of very small&#xD;&#xA;&gt; daughter bubbles are generated upon these collapses, that expand much&#xD;&#xA;&gt; faster than their mothers due to their smaller size. These rapidly&#xD;&#xA;&gt; growing bubble clusters effectively act as buoyancy sources, what&#xD;&#xA;&gt; leads to the formation of bubble-laden plumes whose void fraction&#xD;&#xA;&gt; increases quickly by several orders of magnitude, eventually turning&#xD;&#xA;&gt; most of the liquid into foam.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://gizmodo.com/the-fascinating-science-behind-why-a-tapped-beer-foams-1451022759/1451360561/@jesusdiaz&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.3747" />

In the 18th century, most beers were dark due to being produced with barley malt that was kilned or roasted over wood fires. But from England emerged a new technique using [pale malts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mash_ingredients#Pale_malt), cured in [coke-fuelled kilns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coke_(fuel)). This applied to both ales and lagers, resulting in beers that were bronze, copper or gold—and while you wouldn't look at such colors today and consider them notably &quot;pale,&quot; they certainly were pale in contrast to beers back then. In the turn of the 19th century and beyond, the style spread from England to the rest of Europe—&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; When a new brewery was built in Pilsen in Bohemia in 1842, a coke-fired kiln was imported from England.

The main thing for the beer is to keep the temperature steady and relatively low (around 50F) and keep light out.  Even with brown bottles there's still some UV penetration, which you want none of.  So keep it dark when you're not in there and try to avoid florescent lighting when you're there.  Keeping it organized also helps you minimize your time in there, which keeps light and temperature steady.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I wouldn't worry too much about the air flow as long as it's not completely stagnant and all the areas of the room are getting some air of the right temperature.

Winemakers were allowed to continue producing various grape products like grape juice, and even sold home wine kits with explicit instructions on how to avoid making wine from them.  Very tongue-in-cheek.  A lot of liquor distillers managed to survive somewhat on their liquors being considered &quot;medicinal&quot;.  Beer, however, basically got demolished.  Especially considering their suffering during World War 1, which had just ended when prohibition began.  Any businesses that survived prohibition that used to be breweries either became producers of other products like ice cream or made barely alcoholic barley-based beverages.  Brewing in the US was at a huge disadvantage coming out of prohibition, and the few surviving large companies managed to successfully lobby to have the new distribution laws written to benefit them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, as I mentioned wine and liquor sort of continued to be produced during Prohibition.  This led to their presence in the speakeasies, and their inclusion in the invention of many new cocktails.  People being used to them over the past few years, and the allure of being what was drank in speakeasies, acted as built in marketing.  Which beer lacked.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, beer was much less transportable than wine or liquor, especially liquor.  While localized wineries managed to survive, most people's local brewery had folded.  Liquor and wine became go-to drinks, and the only beer being promoted was from a few larger companies that needed to ramp up to reach everyone.  They were basically able to write their own ticket.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We're sort of in the opposite place now where consumer demand is for beer instead of liquor and wine, and the demand is for beer that's coming from smaller and more regional breweries, which I imagine is how wine was back in the day.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am not an historian, some of this is inference from known fact rather than referenced fact, but I think it makes sense and hopefully it helps you." />

For example:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Beer has much higher shipping costs per dollar worth of product, so shipping rules might need to be different.&#xD;&#xA;- Breweries have a need to keep their product cold at the point of sale, so it might make sense to have them sold in stores that already have coolers (like gas stations), whereas liquor companies wouldn't push as hard for that availability.&#xD;&#xA;- Liquor has no equivalent of the brewpub, so they don't really care much about sales at their production facility.&#xD;&#xA;- Beer has less consumer utility per unit of volume than liquor (ie, you need more of it to have the same amount of fun), so people generally need it closer to their houses.

E. Mechanism of Dehydration Following Alcohol Ingestion. 1963. \[Abstract (HTML)\]][1]&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As far back as the 1930s, researchers were trying to understand whether alcohol—the substance itself—is a diuretic, or indirectly induces chemicals which are diuretic (or which inhibit antidiuretics) or triggers cortical functions that cause diuresis.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [Most] writers either state categorically or imply that alcohol per se has no diuretic action. In 1932, however, from a comparison of the diuretic effects of a given volume of water, with and without alcohol, [...] Murray concluded that alcohol itself was exerting a diuretic action. [...] The diuretic action of alcohol has now been demonstrated on five other subjects, and its mode of action investigated [...]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;[Eggleton, M. G. The Diuretic Action of Alcohol in Man. 1941. \[Full Paper (PDF)\]][2]&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The first paper (1963) actually confirmed that **alcohol—yes, ethanol itself—inhibits antidiuretic hormones, causing diuresis, causing dehydration.** (Caffeine does this too, by the way.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, yeah. That's how that happens.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unrelated, but I found this interesting in the second paper...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; It [the diuresis] is initiated by the _increase_ in blood-alcohol concentration and fails to be maintained if this concentration is kept steady, even at high levels [...] The diuretic response to alcohol differs markedly in one respect from that of the cerebral cortex. The latter is most affected by the _rate_ of increase in blood-alcohol concentration: the greater this rate of increase, the greater the disturbance of function at any absolute concentration. The diuretic response, on the other hand, is dependent mainly on the _duration_ of increasing blood-alcohol concentration and not on the rate of increase (Tables 6, 7). The naturally slow absorber, therefore, tends to give a larger diuretic response than the rapid absorber.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The slower you get drunk, the more dehydrated you'll be!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=568848&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://jp.physoc.org/content/101/2/172.full.pdf" />

I think you have to look at these laws as an intersection of the practical and the cultural.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let's look at two different distinctions you make.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Home Production**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the US, you can usually make your own beer, mead, or wine, but cannot make hard liquor without a license from BATF, state licenses, tax payments, etc.  Exact laws of course vary state by state, but the US tax code contains exemptions for home brewers and wine makers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Part of the reason here is historical.  Liquor is a major tax source, and black market liquor hasn't always been very safe.  We hear stories about wood alcohol making people go blind, but the real problems were either accidental heavy metal poisoning or deliberate adulteration with relatively nasty chemicals.  In practice methyl alcohol was not a major problem, particularly accidental inclusion of it, as in most concentrations primarily makes the hangover significantly worse (btw, red wine is known for harsh hangovers as are some fruit brandies because of methyl alcohol content).  The adulterants have included (and do include in some parts of the world) things like battery acid, caustic soda, and the like.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A second problem of course is safety.  In the distilling process, you are dealing the combination, usually, of heating elements or open flames and a liquid that is roughly as flammable as gasolene.  While it is quite possible to distil safely, there are generally acknowledged gains health and safety-wise to pushing for a formal economy here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Wine Tastings vs Beer Tastings**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here laws vary considerably between states.  For example, the one part of the liquor code that is explicitly applied to home brewers is an exemption for home brewing competitions.  So you can take your beer to a competition without losing the home brewing exemption.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Wine tastings have almost always had some acceptance on the theory that making fine wine has a level of cultural refinement and aesthetic nuance that beer does not (we may find this false but it an attitude --- if you don't believe me, compare reading a wine review with a beer review).  The wine culture is different from the beer culture and so they make a different case.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Again laws here vary state by state.  However, the argument, I think, is that wine tasting is essential to the sales process, while beer drinkers are less picky on average.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In essence these laws have a practical component particularly where hard liquor is concerned, and a cultural component." />

When measured with a hydrometer, it measures the density relative to water. E.g. 1.010 is 1% heavier than water. The units here are [degrees Plato][1] (&amp;deg;P), which describe the amount of dissolved sugars. Here, 15 means 15% dissolved sugar. This means the beer (or more correctly, the [wort][2]) contained 15% sugar before fermentation started.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;RDF - The real degree of fermentation. This is in contrast to the Apparent Degree of Fermentation, which is (OG-FG)/OG. When the final gravity is measured using hydrometer, the alcohol in the beer, being less dense than water ([SG. 0.789][3]) causes the gravity to appear lower, so it looks as though the yeast has fermented more sugar than it actually has. The Real degree of Fermentation takes the alcohol into account and computes the actual amount of sugars fermented. This tells you the how much of the original sugar was fermented (as a percentage). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, what does this mean in practice?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Winter Bock - 15 OG, 62.5 RDF - light, tasty, ever so slightly bitter&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This has an average RDF for a beer that size, so it will be somewhat malty, but not cloying.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Hazelnut Dark - 15 OG, 60.4 RDF - nice bitter red with slightly sweet aftertaste&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This has more dissolved sugars in it compared to the Bock, so you'd expect it to be a thicker mouthfeel and slightly more sweet, although you may not taste the sweetness if it's offset by roasted malts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Chocolate Stout - 14.8 OG, 66.8 RDF - very sweet with hints of chocolate and malt&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Being the driest of all the beers, yet the taste description is given as very sweet. This shows that knowing the residual sugars doesn't tell you the sweetness, simply because there are different kinds of residual sugar. For example, dextrins create body, but have relatively little taste, so would taste not as sweet as a beer containing a lot of residual maltose or glucose. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_measurement#Strength&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wort&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol" />

The reason has nothing to do with alcohol content or getting drunk (some beers like Belgian tripels, imperial stouts, or barley wines can easily clock in at a higher ABV than wines). It's got more to do with the human tongue itself and how taste buds are organized on the tongue. Essentially, beer is a much more complex drink; beer tasters use all of their taste buds while wine drinkers may only use a select few. So when you drink beer, you're not going to be overwhelming any set of taste buds unevenly while you run that risk when drinking wine.  Generally when drinking wine, you're only using your sweet and sour sets of taste buds. For instance, I don't know about you, but I've never really had a bitter wine. I've had sweet or sour wines, but never bitter or salty wines. On the other hand, I've had all of that with beer. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you look at the diagram of the tongue below, you'll notice that the bitter taste bud receptors are on the back of the tongue.

I only have the theory that due to the feeling of the container you drink from, your taste is altered (just like food with the same flavour/taste somehow tastes differently, with a different texture). Additionally I think the amount of beer that flows into your mouth is differently, as well as maybe the turbulence, causing a different amount of carbon dioxide (or nitrogen, depending on your beer culture) to leave the beer before you can actually taste and swallow (which again changes the texture)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

It is benefical if a beer is 8-10 percent or stronger, since an elevated alcohol profile will typically become smoother, mellower and more agreeable. That does not mean lower alcohol percentage beers can not be aged, but higer percentage beers are more suitable most of the time. &#xD;&#xA; 2. *Dark Malt:* like Palo Santo and World Wide Stout. Darker, maltier beer is better because the sweet, residual sugars tend to soften over time. Even lower-alcohol beers with a malt-heavy profile will age better. &#xD;&#xA; 3. *Wild Beers:* living organisms change the beer as it ages in the bottle. Orval Trappist Ale is a classic example. The Belgian pale ale receives a dose of Brettanomyces yeast as it goes in the bottle. The yeast can live in the bottle for years, slowly consuming sugars and protecting the beer’s existing flavors by consuming oxygen. Over time it goes from being bright and hoppy to bready, earthy and spicy. But sometimes they are unstable, because the yeast rapidly works through a beer and alters its character.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*What not to age:* IPA do not improve with age. Hoppy beers are not for aging." />

This is because, unlike the vast majority of wine, beer is carbonated (albeit to varying degrees). When you swallow beer, some of the carbonation escapes the liquid as gas, and actually rises up from your throat into your nose (or, at least, into your nasal passages), carrying with it some of the flavor molecules of the beer. Thus your sense of smell combines with your sense of taste to produce an overall sense of flavor in a manner that is different from what occurs when you drink (uncarbonated) wine.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you spit out your beer, you're ruining the experience.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(This explanation is based on one that I heard years ago from a brewmaster at Anheuser-Busch. I can't remember his exact words, but you get the gist.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On a side note, regarding the important relationship between taste and smell, I'm sure you will see tasters at both beer tastings and especially wine tastings swirl their drink a bit to smell it from the glass before tasting it.

That'll be the most accurate price estimate, although you're not likely to find *really* rare stuff on there because of the small audience.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, there are a number of books on the subject, of which breweriana helpfully lists [a few](http://www.breweriana.com/beer-can-appraisal/books-on-beer-cans.html).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, the [BCCA](http://www.bcca.com/) is the largest organization around beer can collecting, and have a lot of resource son the subject.  You can use their site to find a local chapter and ask someone about your specific collection in person.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To expand on this a little, here is a really quick guide:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- If it's from the mid 70s or so on, it's probably not that valuable.  Exceptions sometimes include aluminum cans, cans with [punch tops](http://imgs.inkfrog.com/pix/UncleDearest/Vintage_Miller_High_Life_1956_Flat_Top_Beer_Can.jpg), and cans with [cone tops](http://www.beercansrus.com/mcart/images/reischcone1.jpg).&#xD;&#xA;- If it's in poor condition, it's probably not worth much unless it's quite rare.  Unless it's better than &quot;grade 2&quot; (defined as &quot;Has a clean label, but there may be rust or other blemishes near the seam, the lid, or the bottom. Colors may be irregular&quot;), it's probably not valuable.&#xD;&#xA;- American OIs (opening instructions, named after the instructions that came with them on how to open them) can be worth $35 to $1000.  Most others before the 70s will have a chance of being between $10 and $500, depending on their rarity." />

But why is that so? I only have the theory that due to the feeling of the container you drink from, your taste is altered (just like food with the same flavour/taste somehow tastes different, with a different texture). Additionally I think the amount of beer that flows into your mouth is different, as well as maybe the turbulence, causing a different amount of carbon dioxide (or nitrogen, depending on your beer culture) to leave the beer before you can actually taste and swallow (which again changes the texture)." />

Even though there is less carbonation than in root beer (and I presume similarly less foam, though still a significant quantity) the irregular surface of the ice cream offers a massively larger number of nucleation sites than the smooth glass of your favorite beer vessel.

One that the alcohol content will &quot;sneak&quot; up on you because it isn't very obvious in the taste.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Quoting from the [Beer Judge Criteria][1]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  Aroma: Complex with moderate to significant spiciness, moderate&#xD;&#xA;&gt; fruity esters and low alcohol and hop aromas. Generous spicy, peppery,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; sometimes clove-like phenols. Esters are often reminiscent of citrus&#xD;&#xA;&gt; fruits such as oranges, but may sometimes have a slight banana&#xD;&#xA;&gt; character. A low yet distinctive spicy, floral, sometimes perfumy hop&#xD;&#xA;&gt; character is usually found. Alcohols are soft, spicy and low in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; intensity. No hot alcohol or solventy aromas. The malt character is&#xD;&#xA;&gt; light. No diacetyl.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Appearance: Deep yellow to deep gold in color. Good clarity.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Effervescent. Long-lasting, creamy, rocky, white head resulting in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; characteristic “Belgian lace” on the glass as it fades.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Flavor: Marriage of spicy, fruity and alcohol flavors supported by a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; soft malt character. Low to moderate phenols are peppery in character.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Esters are reminiscent of citrus fruit such as orange or sometimes&#xD;&#xA;&gt; lemon. A low to moderate spicy hop character is usually found.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Alcohols are soft, spicy, often a bit sweet and low in intensity.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Bitterness is typically medium to high from a combination of hop&#xD;&#xA;&gt; bitterness and yeast-produced phenolics. Substantial carbonation and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; bitterness lends a dry finish with a moderately bitter aftertaste. No&#xD;&#xA;&gt; diacetyl.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium body, although lighter than the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; substantial gravity would suggest (thanks to sugar and high&#xD;&#xA;&gt; carbonation). High alcohol content adds a pleasant creaminess but&#xD;&#xA;&gt; little to no obvious warming sensation. No hot alcohol or solventy&#xD;&#xA;&gt; character. Always effervescent. Never astringent.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Overall Impression: Strongly resembles a Strong Golden Ale but&#xD;&#xA;&gt; slightly darker and somewhat fuller-bodied. Usually has a more rounded&#xD;&#xA;&gt; malt flavor but should not be sweet.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Comments: High in alcohol but does not taste strongly of alcohol. The&#xD;&#xA;&gt; best examples are sneaky, not obvious. High carbonation and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; attenuation helps to bring out the many flavors and to increase the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; perception of a dry finish. Most Trappist versions have at least 30&#xD;&#xA;&gt; IBUs and are very dry. Traditionally bottle-conditioned (“refermented&#xD;&#xA;&gt; in the bottle”).&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; History: Originally popularized by the Trappist monastery at&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Westmalle.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Ingredients: The light color and relatively light body for a beer of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; this strength are the result of using Pilsner malt and up to 20% white&#xD;&#xA;&gt; sugar. Noble hops or Styrian Goldings are commonly used. Belgian yeast&#xD;&#xA;&gt; strains are used – those that produce fruity esters, spicy phenolics&#xD;&#xA;&gt; and higher alcohols – often aided by slightly warmer fermentation&#xD;&#xA;&gt; temperatures. Spice additions are generally not traditional, and if&#xD;&#xA;&gt; used, should not be recognizable as such.

European beer is not served warm.  Some beers, such as real ale (or cask ale) are served at cellar temperature, which while certainly above the temperature of a beer fresh out a refrigerator, at 12-14 degrees celsius (53-57F) is still much colder than room temperature.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**To answer your question:**  Mulled beer **is** heated beer.  As with wine, mulled beer is usually warmed over a low stove or in a crockpot with spices, often including cinnamon, nutmeg, citrus zest, and a sweetener like brown sugar, but it doesn't *need* to include any additional ingredients, particularly if it already has strong spice or fruit characteristics.  So, any beer style that you heat is, in fact, mulled beer.     &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As to styles of beer that would be suitable for mulling, Belgian Strong Dark ales would be good candidates, as would nice fruity lambics.   Barleywine ales, milk stouts, chocolate stouts, and oatmeal stouts I would imagine might also be nice.

Contrary to the previous answer, I find they taste less bitter than typical beers, although perhaps it may be because the bitterness is masked by the other flavors perhaps?  It may depend, though; Chimay yellow label has a note of bitterness that I don't find in, say, a Westmalle.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Part of it depends on what you're used to.

The name was used to indicate the strength of the Westmalle beers. Originally there was the Enkel, Dubbel and Tripel. It is said that they represent the holy trinity. Later quadruppels were added. Both Dubbel and Tripel as name were first used by the Trappist brewery of Westmalle.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Westmalle produced the first dark beer in 1856 named &quot;Dubbel&quot; (the recipe was changed in 1926). Dubbels are dark in color, and tend to have malt flavors dominating over hops. Whereas the Quadrupels have more of a fruit presence, the Dubbels tend to be a bit spicier with strong caramel flavors. They tend to have an ABV of 6.5-9.0%.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some examples:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Chimay Red&#xD;&#xA; - La Trappe Dubbel&#xD;&#xA; - Ommegang&#xD;&#xA; - Westvleteren 8 &#xD;&#xA; - Rochefort 6&#xD;&#xA; - Westmalle Dubbel&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Tripels are lighter color, often blonde. They are generally a lot fruitier and lighter in flavor. The name Tripel originally was first used in 1956 by the Westmalle brewery to name their strongest beer (originally produced in 1930 and named Superbier, it was renamed to Tripel). The ABV is a lot higher than the double,  8.0-12.0%. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some examples:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Tripel Karmeliet&#xD;&#xA; - Westmalle Tripel&#xD;&#xA; - St. Bernardus Tripel&#xD;&#xA; - Leuvense Tripel&#xD;&#xA; - Chimay Cinq Cents Tripel " />

Before the discovery/invention of force carbonation methods, all beer was carbonated naturally via bottle or cask conditioning. But people were brewing alcoholic beverages commonly referred to as beer in antiquity, and evidence from these cultures (ancient China, Neolithic culture, etc) suggests that they were doing this in big clay pots and jugs, which may have had no lids or loose lids. Their vessels probably could not have withstood the pressure of carbonation even if they were using wax or cork to seal the vessels.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So if you were to brew a historical style and you wanted to be truly accurate, then you would not carbonate it. But the modern historical interpretations usually are carbonated (like [Dogfish Head's ancient ales][1]), because they are selling them and Westerners generally prefer them :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As the other answers indicate, there are no &quot;modern styles&quot; (e.g. [styles you'd find in the BJCP style guide][2]), that have [no carbonation][3], but several have little or low carbonation, (e.g. barleywine) mentioned in other answers. [Sahti][4] also has very little carbonation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But people do still drink flat/still beer all over the world, for example there's some uncarbonated corn beers that are popular, like [chicha][5] in Latin America ([Dogfish Head made a Chicha inspired beer][6]) and [umqombothi][7] in South Africa.

Before the discovery/invention of force carbonation methods, all beer was carbonated naturally via bottle or cask conditioning. But people were brewing alcoholic beverages commonly referred to as beer in antiquity, and [evidence][1] from these cultures ([ancient China][2], Neolithic culture, etc) suggests that they were doing this in big stone and earthenware pots and jugs, which may have had no lids or loose lids. Their vessels probably could not have withstood the pressure of carbonation even if they were using wax or cork to seal the vessels.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So if you were to brew a historical style and you wanted to be truly accurate, then you would not carbonate it. But the modern historical interpretations usually are carbonated (like [Dogfish Head's ancient ales][3]), because they are selling them and Westerners generally prefer them :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As the other answers indicate, there are no &quot;modern styles&quot; (e.g. [styles you'd find in the BJCP style guide][4]), that have [no carbonation][5], but several have little or low carbonation, (e.g. barleywine) mentioned in other answers. [Sahti][6] also has very little carbonation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But people do still drink flat/still beer all over the world, for example there's some uncarbonated corn beers that are popular, like [chicha][7] in Latin America ([Dogfish Head made a Chicha inspired beer][8]) and [umqombothi][9] in South Africa. There are other names for similar beers in other regions.

Guinness has actually replaced the widget in some of their &quot;draught&quot; packages as well, I believe the draught bottles.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But for a beer like Miller Genuine Draft, or the other Japanese beers you're mentioning, it just means the beer is unpasteurized which gives it a flavor more like what you get from a fresh, unpasteurized keg rather than a pasteurized and/or filtered bottled beer.

But there are no additional chemical reactions caused by temperature changes, so warming to room temperature and re-chilling multiple times is not going to have any added effects on the beer. Assuming you are drinking it within a few weeks, you won't notice the difference with bottled or canned beer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think this myth took hold from left-over kegs after parties: A half-empty keg that was dispensed by pumping air into it will start to oxidize much more quickly since oxygen is being added to it. When it warms the oxidation speeds up and it tastes stale within a day or two. Keeping it cold slows that down a bit, but even cold it won't last very long. A keg being dispensed using CO2 is a different story: that will last as long as bottled beer and can be warmed and rechilled without ill effects.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In all of this, I am referring to room temperature. Beer left in a car in the sun for hours will start to stale much more quickly, even if bottles are protected from the sunlight. You won't get the skunky flavor caused by the light, but it will taste stale." />

To elaborate:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; there is still the complication that IBUs do not really correlate with perceived bitterness because other aspects of beer affect the perception of bitterness. For example, two beers containing 25 IBUs will be perceived very different with respect to bitterness if one beer had an O.G. of 10 °Plato and finished at 1.5 °Plato and the other beer had an O.G. of 12.5 °Plato and finished at 2.5 °Plato. Begin varying the malt bill by adding crystal malt, for example, and changing the content of various water salts and things become even muddier. This is the reason that measures like the IBU are extremely useful when used within a population of similar beers, but not so handy when looking at very different populations.&#xD;&#xA;- http://byo.com/light-ale/item/2084-measuring-ibus-mr-wizard" />

Glass-making in England was then in its infancy; the first glass-making factory had only recently been established. Many of the first yard glasses have not survived due to their brittle nature, until George Ravenscroft (1674) introduced a new glass process known as the flint glass.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The yard of ale was made and used not for normal drinking purposes, but for feast and manly displays of prowess. During Anglo-Saxon times through the Middle Ages, the English nation has always engaged in the traditions of heavy drinking. As put in Young’s quote “England’s Bane” written in 1617, “He is a man of no fashion that can not drink by the dozen, by the yard, so by measure we drink out of measure.”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Legend suggests that the yard was also used in old England to serve the driver of a coach. Upon arriving at their destination and relieving its passengers, the coachman would stay and the length of the yard glass would allow him some refreshment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some of the same information is repeated in [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yard_of_ale).  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm certain that most of the history of using this style of vessel comes from fellow drinkers trying to show each other up at parties, but aside from the sheer volume (and perhaps limitations of glass-making artisans), how did this length and volume of the glass first come about?  Is there more definitive evidence for the year of birth of the yard, besides the milestone in their history of the introduction of flint glass? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm also curious about whether the volume of the glass was satisfying to stagecoach drivers because of their need to wait long periods for their passenger, or whether it was just easier to hand them a tall glass as they remained in the seat.

It doesn’t contain oysters, just called Oyster Stout as this style of ale is a great complement to shell fish dishes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.classicales.co.uk/Products/Marstons_Oyster_Stout/48" />

In fact, there is no evidence that the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; yard of ale was ever used to refresh coach drivers at all (and if it&#xD;&#xA;&gt; had been, it certainly wouldn’t have been handed up to the driver&#xD;&#xA;&gt; through an inn window, which would be an excellent way to either spill&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the ale or smash the glass). Instead, I think, it seems clear that the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; yard of ale was (1) produced as something of a show-off, for the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; glassmaker and the owner, and (2) primarily or almost solely supplied&#xD;&#xA;&gt; and bought as a “forfeit glass”, for use in drinking games and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; contests of skill, just as it is today.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

With that said, I could probably shoot an email to the professor who I took the class with if you want more info, but I think my answer will suffice (but please let me know, he is a pretty cool guy).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Anyway, I would presume it has something to do with Russian culture and the importance of honey in that part of the world. I remember when I was a kid (like 2nd  grade I think), we read a collection of short, non-fiction stories of a Russian girl and her grandfather, who was a beekeeper. I cannot remember what the name of the book was nor the author nor whether or not the stories took before or during the Soviet era; but I do remember that honey played a really important role in most of the stories.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course there is other more concrete evidence other than my childhood reading material. For instance, just take a look at Russian cuisine. They have a mead-like beverage called [Medovukha][1], which is made with honey and yeast. It's apparently a traditional drink at weddings over there. Also, you've got Russian honey cakes and [other food based items][2]. Finally, honey is also a good preservative as it's antibacterial, so it was often mixed in with jams back in the day to preserve them. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So I'd be surprised if many of the ex-soviet brewers didn't use honey as an additive to their beer. Especially if the beers you have in mind are bottle conditioned, they would need to add a sweetener of sorts for proper carbonation. I've used honey in two of my home brews and I like it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://russiapedia.rt.com/of-russian-origin/medovukha/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://russian.lingualift.com/blog/honey-tradition-russia/" />

To summarize, lambics are exposed to wild yeast (rather than the usual cultivated yeasts) and tend to have a dry, tart taste.  These are not heavy-bodied beers, nor are they bitter.  (Hops are used for their preservative effect, but old, dry hops are used to minimize the flavor impact.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Frequently, lambics (like the one you had) have fruit added later in fermentation.  Common fruits for this include raspberry, peach, and cherry, and I've also encountered apple.  The sweetness you're tasting probably comes from the fruit (and some of these varieties taste sweeter to me than others).  If you'd like to try a lambic that doesn't have the fruit, which is likely to be less sweet, look for &quot;gueuze&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;" />

I don't know of any drinking culture that really does encourage the *warm* serving of beer in any normal understanding of the word. 'Warm' really refers to cellar temperature rather than refrigerator or just-above-zero temperature. A similar temperature to that you'd expect in red wine would be appropriate for the 'warm' beers.

With that said, I could probably shoot an email to the professor who I took the class with if you want more info, but I think my answer will suffice (but please let me know, he is a pretty cool guy).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Anyway, I would presume it has something to do with Russian culture and the importance of honey in that part of the world. I remember when I was a kid (like 2nd  grade I think), we read a collection of short, non-fiction stories of a Russian girl and her grandfather, who was a beekeeper. I cannot remember what the name of the book was nor the author nor whether or not the stories took before or during the Soviet era; but I do remember that honey played a really important role in most of the stories.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course there is other more concrete evidence other than my childhood reading material. For instance, just take a look at Russian cuisine. They have a mead-like beverage called [Medovukha][1], which is made with honey and yeast. It's apparently a traditional drink at weddings over there. Also, you've got Russian honey cakes and [other food based items][2]. Finally, honey is also a good preservative as it's antibacterial, so it was often mixed in with jams back in the day to preserve them. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So I'd be surprised if many of the ex-soviet brewers didn't use honey as an additive to their beer. Especially if the beers you have in mind are bottle conditioned, they would need to add a sweetener of sorts for proper carbonation. I've used honey in two of my home brews and I like it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Perhaps some substantiating points:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Baltika Medovoe Light seems to be a popular &quot;first Russian beer&quot; to try. It's a pale lager with natural honey added.&#xD;&#xA; - Indeed honey does seem to have played a central role in Russian culture.&#xD;&#xA; &gt; Like the Assumption, the three &quot;Saviors&quot; (_Spas_), August 1, 6, and 16, were associated with the fruits of the earth. The first was called the &quot;Honey&quot; (_medovyi_) or &quot;Wet Savior&quot; (_mokryi Spas_), signifying either the gathering of honey or the religious procession and blessing of the waters traditional for this day.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &lt;sup&gt;[Ivanits, L. &quot;Russian Folk Belief.&quot; [http://books.google.com]](http://books.google.com/books?id=-s36xYcqG1EC).&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; According to Russian historian Vasili Kliuchevskii (1841–1911), we must learn about the Russian forest, river and steppe in order to understand the Russian people. [...] &quot;The forest provided the Russian with oak and pine to build his house, it warmed him with aspen and birch, it lit his hut with birchwood splinters, it shod him in birch bast sandals, it gave him plates and dishes, clothed him in hides and furs and fed him honey. The forest was the best shelter from his enemies.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &lt;sup&gt;[Riordan, J. &quot;Russian Fairy Tales and Their Collectors.&quot; [http://books.google.com]](http://books.google.com/books?id=EDvKpNzNBD0C)&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; It's notable how closely intertwined honey and their ideals of paradise were, as found by a search for the term &quot;honey&quot; in [&quot;The Paradise Myth in Eighteenth-century Russia: Utopian Patterns in Early Secular Russian Literature and Culture&quot;](http://books.google.com/books?id=C46rAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=honey#v=snippet&amp;q=honey&amp;f=false) (Baehr, S. L.).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, though still conjecture, it may be so that Russian culture has had a higher demand for honey notes in their foods and beverages, naturally selecting those tastes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Frankly, it may simply be the case that there's not an objective (&quot;provable&quot;) answer to this question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://russiapedia.rt.com/of-russian-origin/medovukha/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://russian.lingualift.com/blog/honey-tradition-russia/" />

Nothing in there *appears* to prevent brewers from filling any growler, but the standard interpretation from both the ABCC and the brewers is that they believe it makes it illegal for them to fill any growlers other than their own, and that is the policy by which they seem to all operate.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for retail establishments, there do seem to be some non-brewery bars that offer growlers, (see Ducali Pizzeria and Bar on [this list][2]) but those may be for on-premise use.  There was a proposal for a bill to allow on-premise / off-premise licensees to do growler fills but as far as I can tell, it died in committee, primarily due to strong opposition from craft brewers who were worried it would cut into their bottle profits.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Beyond issues of distribution, the joint legislative committee also heard from industry members interested in allowing both on- and off-premise retailers to fill beer containers up to 64 ounces for take-away and off-site consumption. The bill, sponsored by Representative William Pignatelli, has caused some division in the industry between retailers and small brewers. “We think it would be a disaster for our business by cannibalizing our bottle sales, our only real income source,” says one small Massachusetts brewer. “We for one couldn't thrive in a situation where the profit on bottled beer transfers from brewery to store or bar.”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Source: http://www.beveragebusiness.com/archives/article.php?cid=1&amp;eid=88&amp;aid=2031&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.mass.gov/abcc/regulations.htm#LicensesandPermits6&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://growlerdirectory.com/growler-stations/Massachusetts-MA" />

With hundreds (thousands!) of beers in Belgium, Chimay is a popular beer, but far from the most popular. I think that's the reason why they can sell a lot abroad.&#xD;&#xA;Also a fact, beers like Westvleteren (that won a lot of prizes) are even in Belgium (where it is brewed) pretty rare and hard to get. Basically you have to go to the Abbey yourself to get some beer. If you're there, you only get ONE crate (6 beers) per person. I was lucky enough to visit Westvleteren a while ago and found out that in the nearby cafe you also could buy one crate per person, however there were only about 100 crates available that day and only one type was available. You can drink all types though by ordering it to drink in the café (3 types).&#xD;&#xA;If you would ever want to taste Westvleteren but cannot find it, Sint-Bernardus Abt 12 is a very similar beer.

Radler means cyclist in German.  The way I understand the story is that a small pub owner was besieged one day by a slew of thirsty cyclists and knew that his beer supply wouldn't hold out, so he cut it by mixing it with some sort of lemon drink he had on hand.  As far as I know this origin story isn't confirmed and Radler likely grew out of folk attempts to &quot;sessionize&quot; and extend the supply of leftover lager through the summer when lower alcohol and more refreshing drinks were wanted.  According to wikipedia the first printed mention of Radler as a drink was in 1912: http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/buch/4594/20  I believe contemporary Radlers use a lemon-soda sort of drink that's more like a carbonated lemonade than what we'd think of as soda.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Shandy itself is short for Shandygaff which is a British English term from the mid-1800s referring to beer cut with ginger beer or ginger ale. In fact, the OED still defines it as such while Mariam-Webster has loosened it up and allows for any non-alcoholic drink to be used in place of ginger.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As to their reputation, if you'll forgive me a little supposition, most commercial shandies are very pale duplications of mixing lemonade (or lemon soda) with a beer yourself.  The first commercial example I saw was Lienenkugel's and it was abusively sweet.  Sam Adams and The Traveler have fared a little better, but I think a major problem is that to commercially produce a shandy you need to heavily filter and pasteurize the beer and lemonade  to make sure the sugar doesn't ferment or use a non-fermentable sugar, which would change the taste from fresh beer and fresh lemonade.  At the scale a lot of breweries operate at, it possible some of them aren't even using real lemonade regardless of sugar type.  Also, while continuously popular in Europe, beer cocktails never caught on or were lost in America and we tend to think of them now as marketing gimmicks by macro-brewers (Bud Light Lime, Bud Chelada, Miller Chill), though as they become more visible, I think they'll become more accepted.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, fresh shandy is incredible, I like using wheat beer." />

Beer is technically not distilled. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As the definition you cited says, beer is the product of fermenting sugar derived from cereal grain which is dissolved in water. So water + grain + yeast = beer. The grain has to undergo a saccharification process where the carbohydrate chains (starches) in the grain are transformed into sugar (glucose, fructose, sucrose, maltose...) which is then converted into alcohol by yeast. Fermentable sugar is extracted from barley through [malting][2] and [mashing][3]. The yeast is generally added to the *wort* (unfermented sugary water) manually by the brewer or wild yeast can fall into the beer from the air. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other processes may be involved with fermenting other grains. For example, in sake brewing, [koji][4] (a type of mold) is grown on rice (and soybeans) before fermentation in order to convert starches into fermentable sugars, as rice does not contain the enzymes needed to convert its starches into sugars (note: sake is generally not consider beer, but there are beers made with significant quantities of rice, up to 100% rice beer is possible).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hops is not a necessary ingredient in beer, and beer was made for thousands of years before people started adding hops to it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These strong beers like Snake Venom are generally brewed to this high ABV level through freeze &quot;distillation.&quot; This isn't really distillation, because no heat is involved, so people still call them beers. But this is a concentration process similar to distillation. Alcohol has a lower freezing point than water, so when you freeze beer, you can remove the ice and you're left with a more concentrated beer. This is the process used in the German eisbock style. The brewers also start with a high ABV beer, using special ingredients (sugar sources other than malt, like table sugar) along with strains of yeast that can tolerate high levels of alcohol and still continue to live and ferment. This process can be somewhat difficult and expensive, so it gets attention. In my opinion it's a novelty, but I guess people like it, because they sell a lot of it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malt&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mash_%28beer%29&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.themadfermentationist.com/2010/05/making-koji-for-sake.html" />

Necessity may also play a part (Given a choice between a warm beer vs no beer it depends how thirsty you are!).  &#xD;&#xA;German-style lagers are almost exclusively recommended to be served no lower than 6C no higher than 9C, but I often find that the last (and warmest) mouthfuls from a glass actually have the most flavour - but I would always start with the lager cold when possible.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Real ales are a different story. On the continent of Europe there still seems to be a myth that British drink their beer 'luke-warm', but if served at that temperature most Brits would complain (and maybe continue to drink it while complaining). I believe the phrase 'serve cool' rather than 'cold' applies. Some live, bottled beers actually suffer from being too cold. On of my favourites, Black Sheep Ale develops a 'chill haze' - going a little cloudy if left in the fridge too long. 13C is about right for such beers.&#xD;&#xA;Reference the book Beer For Dummies!" />

Snifters are widely used for beer and generally for two reasons, in my experience.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. As you suspect, the bowl shaped glass helps to concentrate the aroma.  However, this isn't unique to the snifter as many types of beer glasses incorporate a narrowing throat to provide this effect. &#xD;&#xA; 2. Quantity.  With a glass of beer that has a particularly high alcohol content, or particularly strong flavor, you'll often get much less than a standard 12-16 oz. pour.  The beer you refer to for instance, the Big Bad Baptist, has an alcohol content of 11.8% ABV, which closer to wine than beer, (and wine has a standard 5oz serving size per glass, or thereabouts) so it calls for a smaller serving size.  However, a 5oz or 6oz serving would look rather silly in a pint glass, so a snifter is more appropriate in proportion. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; " />

Unfiltered beers like real ale have much more yeast in suspension, and yeast has a tendency to make you gassy when digested.  Lager in general has very little yeast due to the long, cold, aging process.  I believe commercial examples are filtered as well.  In general most commercial beers are filtered, or at least have had the yeast killed off somehow, which mitigates the effect.  Real ale's major selling points are that it's unpasteurized and unfiltered, and is refermented in the cask...so it's basically got way more yeast and way more active yeast than other kinds of beer.  And then cask ales are served from a tap at the front near the bottom...near the yeast.  Basically the perfect storm of fart-induction." />

Most popular with everyone I know is home-made strawberry wine, but plum wine is a favourite, too, and any berry or fruit is used, with every family that owns a garden making one or two bottles of these fruit wines each autumn.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Apples are different because we grow so much more of them than strawberries or plums, and they are regularly pressed into apple juice in large quantities by the fruit grower cooperatives that sell it to the beverage industry. If you don't pasteurize the juice (for long term stability), it turns alcoholic after a couple of days, and after the apple harvest everyone gets large cannisters of freshly pressed juice from the cooperative presses, bakes onion tarts (&quot;Dinnele&quot;), and eats and drinks this seasonal speciality, with more or less alchohol, depending on taste.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;Most&quot; ([must][7]) or &quot;Süßmost&quot; (sweet must) is freshly pressed juice; once it has turned alcoholic (and sour) it has different names in different areas, such as &quot;Sauermost&quot; (sour must) and [Apfelwein][8] (apple wine).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Within southern Germany and Austria, Frankfurt is not specifically famous for apple wine, the drink, because it is drunk elsewhere, too. What the region around Frankfurt is somewhat well-known for are the festivities surrounding the end of the apple harvest and the pessing of apple juice, which have been the background theme for a musical tv show, [Zum Blauen Bock][9] (The Blue Goat Buck), that ran from 1957 to 1987.

The foam can add to both the flavor and the texture of your beer.  It is preference for sure, and if you don't like it, then you don't like it, but I'd encourage you to try it from time to time with an open mind.  The head of a beer is quite complex, consisting of proteins that are acted on by the hops, the yeast, and the carbonation. Because of the complexity, creating the perfect recipe for foam in a beer is something the brewers spend quite a lot of time and energy on, and it's a fairly integral part of a good beer. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that there are exceptions. Truly non-carbonated beer, like Samuel Adams Utopias will not have a head. Hever, from what I've read, that specific example is probably more closely comparable to a fortified wine than a common beer in any case.  " />

You can call and make an appointment and IF you get an&#xD;&#xA;    appointment then you must drive there at the appointed time to pick&#xD;&#xA;    up your crate of bier. If you can't make it at the appointed time&#xD;&#xA;    then you lose out, and you must start the process all over again. I&#xD;&#xA;    forget how much bier this is for, but I think it is 24-48 bottles. Indeed when you make the appointment then you must supply your license place number which they use to keep track of you. They will not allow you to make 2 appointments with the same license plate number in a 60 day period. Additionally, the phone number you must call to get an appointment is always busy, I have heard of people using automatic redial for hours before they finally get through. &#xD;&#xA; 2. If you are in the area (again you will need a car, because there is no public transport, and biking there is unreasonable from most places.) You can pop in and there is a small shop next to the monastery where you can buy a 6 pack per person without appointment, and also with out a huge price markup. Of course while you are there you can also eat some good food, and buy other items that the monks make and sell. This is much less hassle, but you cannot get much bier, so it may not be worth trekking all the way out there specifically for this.  However if you are in the area already and you have the time to take a small detour then you should certainly pop in for lunch or dinner and get some tasty brew.&#xD;&#xA; 3. Finally if you are in the Benelux region you can sometimes find Westvleteren in local shops or cafes, however the prices range from 10-16 euros per bottle (in Amsterdam) which is a lot more than you will pay at the monastery.

You said it's a home built system, yes?  So is this a mini-fridge conversion, chest freezer/keezer conversion, or some other kit?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Anyway, what length are the beer lines?  Generally you need to balance CO2 pressure against beer lines to avoid consistently foamy pours.  If your system isn't properly balanced the beer will always be foamy, on every pour.  I have 5-6 foot lines in my kegerator and it works pretty well for me, when I was having foamy pour problems everyone suggested replacing them with 10 foot lines just to make damn sure the pour wasn't too violent.  Also making sure the lines are clean.  Any beer stone or other sediment in the lines is going to cause foam.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Serving warmer with lower CO2 would also be a better step.  One frustrating thing about these sorts of adjustments is that it takes time for equilibrium to be hit.  So if you lower the CO2 pressure, the headspace is still pressurize.  You'll need to vent the keg via the pressure release valve.  Same deal with raising the temperature.  Once the beer actually comes up to the new temp, there will have been CO2 driven out of solution that you need to vent from the headspace via the pressure release valve.  It's a pain.  Regulators will also often have their own pressure valve, which you should poke and vent slightly when setting the pressure...especially when coming down since excess pressure in the system is going to mess with the reading.  So vent, watch it rise to the actual pressure, then adjust, vent again, and watch.  It takes some time but generally once you set it there's very little change required.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's hard to tell without seeing the speed of your pour.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Definitely check the keg temperature itself.  As a homebrewer I reuse kegs, so I have stickers on all my kegs that have a little temperature line.  These liquid crystal thermometers, like [this one][1], are pretty cheap.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can also check the ambient temperature using a regular thermometer and a small glass of water.  You should check temperature at multiple spots inside the kegerator, so you could fill some tumblers or shot glasses with water and place them at the bottom of the kegerator, then maybe on top of the keg, and then maybe a back shelf if you have anything like that.  This lets you know if you have any hot spots which you can reduce by reorganizing tubes or tossing a small computer case fan in there.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, if you haven't disabled the dome light in the fridge, do so or find some way to make sure the switch stays down beyond a doubt.  When I first built my kegerator I was getting incredibly foamy pours and a huge contributor wound up being the dome light kept coming on and heating up the tops of the kegs and the beer in my lines.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another final check is the temperature inside of the tower.  If you have no way for the cold air to get from the body of the fridge into the tower the lines in the tower will get warm and cause foamy beer, though if the CO2 pressure is set correctly, this would likely only result in the first 1-2 pours being foamy, then it calms down until the lines warm back up.  A lot of people will put fans or run copper tubes up the towers.  I filled mine with insulation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.amazon.com/Exo-Terra-Liquid-Crystal-Thermometer/dp/B00026Z4PS/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1398947179&amp;sr=8-3-fkmr0&amp;keywords=keg%20temperature%20strip &quot;this one&quot;" />

Brewers, like any other businesses, like for the general public to know that the anonymous tapped beer you're drinking is theirs.  That is why they provide branded glasses to bars, and request (or require) that their beer be served in their glasses.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Is there a benefit to the mildly curved shape of this glass for this type of beer?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In my observations, yes, there is.  While the throat may not narrow as severely as a brandy snifter, the effect of concentrating the aroma is still achieved. Eyeballing it, I'd say that the curvature is somewhere in between that of my champagne flutes and my red wines glasses, which are presumed to have the same general effect.  More generally I'd say that a glass with a narrowing or restricted throat does concentrate the aroma, and the degree of restriction doesn't seem to matter significantly, to my nose.  (Assuming it isn't *too* great, that is.  Beer in a bottle or can, for instance, is definitely at a disadvantage.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'd like to also look at a few of the reasons they state in their marketing material as well.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The authentic shape of the body encourages the perfect balance of C02 and liquid, enhancing head retention and flavor.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't have any evidence to back this up, but I suspect that this is probably the most legitimate of the claims.  This would have a significant effect on the experience of drinking the beer, it is going to be specific to their recipe, and it's a reason that's often given for custom beer glassware.  (Boston Beer Company laser etches the bottom of their Sam Adams Boston Lager glass to enhance cavitation, for instance.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The angles at the bottom cause a wave that works in harmony with the liquid alchemy. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have no idea what this means.  Alchemy is the term for pre-chemistry, and primarily deals with trying to turn ordinary substances into gold.  I assume they're trying to insinuate that the glass magically turns Stella into better beer. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The stem provides a means to hold the chalice so that the Stella Artois stays cold longer &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is plausible, and perhaps unfortunate.  This is why you are supposed to hold red wine glasses by the bowl (to warm the wine) and white wine glasses by the stem (to keep it cool.)   However, with wine, a serving is generally five ounces or so, compared to twelve or more of lager.   The effect certainly won't be the same given the significantly higher mass.   The unfortunate bit is that colder is not generally what you want when you're talking about good beer.  Colder is the realm of the cheap macro-brews like Coors Light.   Cold subdues flavor compounds, which is useful when the flavor of the beer is nasty, and not so useful when it's pleasant.  This certainly isn't a a requirement or general best practice for lagers as you won't find stemmed glassware used for Boston Beer's Samuel Adams Lager glass: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Samuel Adams Boston Lager Glass][1] &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;or my classic Spiegelau Lager glass: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Speieglau lager glass][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;or any of the glasses you'll see used for the many fine Lagers of Germany.  So, I have to suppose one of the following two reasons.  First, they may simply be pandering to the general belief that colder beer is better.  Second, it would be unfortunate if they were trying to hide a lack of quality by trying to ensure the beer was too cold to taste properly.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, and I've left this to last, because it's purely my opinion...I think they've chosen the chalice glass specifically because it's fancy, and that's the image they want to portray for their beer.  When people see the Stella glass, they don't want their beer to be lumped in with the pint-glass styles, they want it to stand out as sophisticated, and the chalice specifically gives it that cachet.   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, my top line and bottom line are down to marketing, with a bit of truth and a bit of fiction to all the bits in between. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/DMcwF.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/wn6wv.png" />

In London (UK) we have a brewery producing a 2.8% abv beer (Redemption brewery, beer name escapes me) which is packed with hops and of greater hop depth than many IPAs. Batches of a beer that are brewed to be low alcohol will necessarily be different to those brewed at full strength which is why I would hope (pray?) that any brewer whose product is worth drinking would make a different beer, brewed at low strength for these markets. These beers can be as flavoursome and exciting as, if not more so than, higher strength beers.&#xD;&#xA;The process to make the beer lower ABV is simply reducing the amount of sugar that can be converted into alcohol by using a lower sugar content mash either using specific lower sugar malts, using less malt, or using a yeast that will not support higher alcohol concentrations (alcohol kills yeast...!). Using less yeast won't work as the given yeast will continue to multiply to make up the shortfall. If you are not making real beer halting the fermentation early by killing the yeast with heat (or similar) will produce a lower alcohol beer but it will be sweeter as there is more unfermented sugar. Fining and serving real ale before fermentation has produced a higher strength may have a similar effect for those types of beer.&#xD;&#xA;Since alcohol dissolves flavouring compounds better than water it is much harder to brew a highly flavoured weak beer *but* this may be offset by taste complexity.&#xD;&#xA;Larger breweries will reduce alcohol levels chemically post-production by boiling off alcohol or similar. this will reduce the flavouring compounds in the beer (see GCSE fractional distillation notes or similar for details) and so make the beer taste weaker. These are produced at mass market quantities and even the full strength product is pretty awful compared with crafted or real beers." />

Focusing on lactobacillus, which is your common bacteria used in cheese making, lactobacillus can introduce more lactic acid into the beer. This anaerobic bacteria is more active either before fermentation has started (either by contamination or inoculation) and after fermentation has ended.

The prices are wholesale price so cheaper than they would be in a store so that they make a profit.&#xD;&#xA;I help to run a beer festival in the UK and we tend to order out beers from an distributors or direct from the brewery (we know most of the 50+ breweries in London well enough that a few donate some barrels as well as we are a not for profit organization).

Assuming you are referring to Becks Premium Lager (as opposed to one of their other offerings), Becks has an IBU (International Bitterness Units) of 20 where Heineken has 23 IBUs.  Based on IBUs, Heineken should be more bitter but not by much.  What you're tasting could be accounted for by batch to batch variation on behalf of the brewer or the conditions that the bottles were stored (length of storage, lighting, etc.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Furthermore, the bitterness in most of Becks' beers come from the use of darker malts, while the majority of the bitterness in Heineken comes from the use of (pellet) hops. &#xD;&#xA;This makes the bitterness in Becks tend towards roastier flavors, and the bitterness in Heineken to tend to be more herbaceous or floral. It is possible that you are more personally sensitive to one set of those flavor compounds.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that IBUs are an imperfect measurement of bitterness so only consider it as an approximation.  Many people say that differences in bitterness beyond 100 IBUs are indiscernible but that is often conflicted.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Answered by: the Gastrograph Team" />

You can have a beer with a larger number of IBUs but also a large amount of residual sweetness such as caramel malts) and this will generally taste sweeter than a beer that has a lower IBUs and almost no residual sweetness.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Each brewer designs a beer with a taste profile in mind, and then seeks ingredients and sometimes process changes to arrive at this desired flavor profile. This often requires several iterations until the desired result is reached, and even then it may not be possible to reach it every time, so the brewer may also choose to blend beers from different batches to arrive close to the desired result. The same is true for Heineken - their Quality Assurance team will have been given clear guidelines on the spec for the beer, both as hard and fast measurable, objective facts (IBUs, Color, carbonation, diacetyl, fusel alcohols, esters etc...) and also as subjective - how it tastes. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So the final answer about why one beer is more bitter than another is because their respective breweries have decided that's the flavor they want, and they have crafted a brew to produce their chosen flavor profile.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

One alternative would be to replace the air with an inert gas (perhaps with a product like [Private Preserve][1]).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To minimise loss of carbonation, you really only need to reseal the bottle so it is airtight: carbon dioxide will stop coming out of solution once the pressure builds.

The company did not spend sufficient time testing the new process, and tiny green flakes appeared in the beer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Internet sleuthing reveals [this *Beer Connoisseur* article][3], which gives more info and claims that the flakes were, in fact, white:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Schlitz decided to use another beer stabilizer instead, one that would be filtered out of the final product and thus would not have to be listed as among the ingredients. Unfortunately, what Schlitz's brewing technicians did not know was that the new anti-haze agent, called Chill-garde, would react in the bottles and cans with the foam stabiliser they also used, to cause protein to settle out. At its best this protein looked liked tiny white flakes floating in the beer and at its worst it looked like mucus, or &quot;snot,&quot; as one observer bluntly called it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;After more research, I can't find any other references to Schlitz being [literally] green.

I have the following hypotheses:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* *Beer Connoisseur* also mentions that Schlitz switched from whole to pellet hops; coupled with inadequate filtration, this could have led to green flakes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Adults doing research thought of &quot;snot&quot; like kids, which meant that a &quot;snotlike&quot; substance in beer was probably green.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* This is a misunderstanding created by non-brewers reading that Schlitz was &quot;green&quot; (which does appear frequently in search results); combined with knowing that there were flakes, and that the liquid of beer is generally amber-ish, it must have been [to someone unfamiliar with &quot;green beer&quot; being beer which needs to be further aged] that the flakes were literally green.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* *Beer Connoisseur* is wrong, and the flakes were in fact green.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Does anyone have first-hand experience with this era of beer?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(this is crossposted from [the Homebrewing channel)][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/12438/confirm-refute-green-schlitz-myth&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://books.google.com/books?id=xe7Ye5bw8wgC&amp;pg=PA321&amp;lpg=PA321&amp;dq=schlitz%20hit%20the%20fan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=P7scBc9ggZ&amp;sig=hYi3R5FykZWjVvbwTmYbbBVlxoY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fZ2WU-OUNM3eoATA8ICwBA&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=schlitz%20hit%20the%20fan&amp;f=false&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.beerconnoisseur.com/the-fall-of-schlitz" />

Somewhat surprisingly, a lot of new-ish pubs and bars will actually be provided with very low cost or even free beer (or other alcohol) on the condition that only that brand will be on tap for *x* amount of months/years. This generally happens with bigger breweries. Pubs also will sometimes *sell* taps to breweries. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In terms of cost, no, it wouldn't be cheaper for a pub to go the the local liquor store and buy the beer there (might be 20%+ more expensive). When a brewery sells to a organization (pub, restaurant, liquor store etc.) it is generally at a 18-26% discount so that it can then be marked up by the pubs at a reasonable price.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A lot of this is the same sort of way that pubs get their chicken wings, just more heavily regulated." />

The prices are wholesale price so cheaper than they would be in a store so that they make a profit.&#xD;&#xA;I help to run a beer festival in the UK and we tend to order our beers from distributors or direct from the brewery (we know most of the 50+ breweries in London well enough that a few donate some barrels as well as we are a not for profit organization). A distributor works partially as a broker between breweries and buyers and partially as a wholesaler, the difference is that they tend to keep the beer at the brewery and only pick it up and transport it to fulfill an order. One of the distributors that we use is FlyingFirkin http://www.flyingfirkin.co.uk/ , just to give you some idea of how it works.&#xD;&#xA;Additionally, in the UK, duty is paid at point of sale so VAT is paid on the beer when it is bought from the supplier but duty is only applied when it is sold to the end user, or &quot;drinker&quot;, and so the price paid from the supplier will be significantly lower." />

The actual beer you drank was likely brewed in St. Louis, however, as Beck's is wholly owned by AB InBev.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Pale Lagers as a style are usually straw colored, up to a light gold with a white head.  The flavor is very light and dry with only slight malty sweetness.  A little crisp hop bitterness without too much hop aroma.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most &quot;macrobrews&quot; will be somewhat similar, though the stock &quot;American&quot; variant of Pale Lager like Budweiser or Miller will have a corn sugar flavor to them and likely be a bit lighter in body.  Beck's claimed to adhere to the German Beer Purity Law which would prohibit the use of an adjunct like corn.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;St. Pauli Girl is a very similar beer, and I think is even brewed in the same town as the original Beck's.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you want to stick with imports just about any pale German lager is going to do it for you since it's a very traditional style.  Anything by Spaten, Hacker-Pschorr, or Weihenstephan is solid and usually pretty easy to get ahold of.  Pilsner-Urquell is also a great beer, but it's in the Pilsner style so while it's still a pale lager Pilsners can have a sulfur-y or buttery tinge due to the green bottles and slight diacetyl.  Pilsners also have a strong hop character and bitterness.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you wanted to try local or American brewed versions just about anyone's Session Lager (Full Sail comes to mind, as does Notch if you're near MA at all) should be similar.  According to [this list][1] on BeerAdvocate you should be near Berghoff and Baderbrau which will both make traditional German styles.  Some breweries, Baderbrau included, will call their pale lager a &quot;Lawnmower beer&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Branching out, Sam Adams Boston Lager is a style called Vienna Lager which may also appeal you.  Though it will be significantly maltier than Beck's.  Anything with Dortmunder in the name will also be similar, though hoppier but not like an American Pale Ale or IPA or anything.  You might also be interested in any brewery's Cream Ale, which is an Ale version of the Pale Lager style.  Kolsch style beers may also appeal to you since they share the same light body and slight maltiness.  Kolsch's are hybrid beers which are fermented warm like an Ale would be, but then cold conditioned like a Lager.  Officially Kolsch can only be brewed in Cologne, Germany, but many American breweries will make a Kolsch style since it drinks really well in the summer and provides more flavor variety than pale lager or Cream Ale.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Does that help?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.beeradvocate.com/place/city/6/" />

I personally can forgive this, since pears are closely related to apples, and the result is quite tasty.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The &quot;beer&quot; part of ginger beer is due to the fermentation process involved in its creation.  In this way, it is more similar to &quot;root beer&quot;, since ginger is a root, like the sassafras root used in root beer and birch roots used in birch beer.  The website todayifoundout.com has a well referenced article for [Why Root Beer is Called That](http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2013/07/why-root-beer-is-called-that/) covering the naming of root beer.  If the ginger based version isn't fermented, but is instead ginger flavouring added to carbonated water, it would be &quot;ginger ale&quot;; I have no idea why, since an India Pale Ale is certainly fermented.  Even with ginger products, the differentiation is not really all that terribly strict, as noted by this [Huffington Post article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/20/ginger-ale-vs-ginger-beer_n_1438420.html).  Initially, ginger beer, root beer, birch beer, etc, were frequently alcoholic, but Prohibition ruined that for the U.S.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As a bit of a side note, the alcoholic versions are making a wonderful comeback (in my personal opinion) with [Sprecher's](https://www.sprecherbrewery.com/hrb.php) and [Small Town Brewery](http://smalltownbrewery.com/?page_id=11) for root beer.  I personally have not seen as much alcoholic ginger beer, but [Crabbies](http://www.crabbiesgingerbeer.co.uk/) from the U.K. is quite good.

Hop aroma may range from none to a light, spicy or floral hop presence. Low levels of yeast character (green apples, DMS, or fruitiness) are optional but acceptable. No diacetyl.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Appearance:** Very pale straw to medium yellow color. White, frothy head&#xD;&#xA;&gt; seldom persists. Very clear.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Flavor:** Crisp and dry flavor with some low levels of grainy or&#xD;&#xA;&gt; corn-like sweetness. Hop flavor ranges from none to low levels. Hop&#xD;&#xA;&gt; bitterness at low to medium-low level. Balance may vary from slightly&#xD;&#xA;&gt; malty to slightly bitter, but is relatively close to even. High levels&#xD;&#xA;&gt; of carbonation may provide a slight acidity or dry &quot;sting.&quot; No&#xD;&#xA;&gt; diacetyl. No fruitiness.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Mouthfeel:** Light body from use of a high percentage of adjuncts such&#xD;&#xA;&gt; as rice or corn. Very highly carbonated with slight carbonic bite on&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the tongue.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Overall Impression:** Very refreshing and thirst quenching.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Comments:** Strong flavors are a fault. An international style including&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the standard mass-market lager from most countries.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Ingredients:** Two- or six-row barley with high percentage (up to 40%)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; of rice or corn as adjuncts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some beers bill themselves as a &quot;Pale Ale&quot;, like Rolling Rock also use adjuncts, like rice.  This notation is designed to set them apart from those other beers.  It should be noted that the BJCP guidelines for a Pale Ale are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Aroma:** Usually moderate to strong hop aroma from dry hopping or late&#xD;&#xA;&gt; kettle additions of American hop varieties. A citrusy hop character is&#xD;&#xA;&gt; very common, but not required. Low to moderate maltiness supports the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; hop presentation, and may optionally show small amounts of specialty&#xD;&#xA;&gt; malt character (bready, toasty, biscuity). Fruity esters vary from&#xD;&#xA;&gt; moderate to none. No diacetyl. Dry hopping (if used) may add grassy&#xD;&#xA;&gt; notes, although this character should not be excessive.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Appearance:** Pale golden to deep amber. Moderately large white to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; off-white head with good retention. Generally quite clear, although&#xD;&#xA;&gt; dry-hopped versions may be slightly hazy.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Flavor:** Usually a moderate to high hop flavor, often showing a citrusy&#xD;&#xA;&gt; American hop character (although other hop varieties may be used). Low&#xD;&#xA;&gt; to moderately high clean malt character supports the hop presentation,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; and may optionally show small amounts of specialty malt character&#xD;&#xA;&gt; (bready, toasty, biscuity). The balance is typically towards the late&#xD;&#xA;&gt; hops and bitterness, but the malt presence can be substantial. Caramel&#xD;&#xA;&gt; flavors are usually restrained or absent. Fruity esters can be&#xD;&#xA;&gt; moderate to none. Moderate to high hop bitterness with a medium to dry&#xD;&#xA;&gt; finish. Hop flavor and bitterness often lingers into the finish. No&#xD;&#xA;&gt; diacetyl. Dry hopping (if used) may add grassy notes, although this&#xD;&#xA;&gt; character should not be excessive.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Mouthfeel:** Medium-light to medium body. Carbonation moderate to high.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Overall smooth finish without astringency often associated with high&#xD;&#xA;&gt; hopping rates.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Overall Impression:** Refreshing and hoppy, yet with sufficient&#xD;&#xA;&gt; supporting malt.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Comments:** There is some overlap in color between American pale ale and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; American amber ale. The American pale ale will generally be cleaner,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; have a less caramelly malt profile, less body, and often more&#xD;&#xA;&gt; finishing hops.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; **History:** An American adaptation of English pale ale, reflecting&#xD;&#xA;&gt; indigenous ingredients (hops, malt, yeast, and water). Often lighter&#xD;&#xA;&gt; in color, cleaner in fermentation by-products, and having less caramel&#xD;&#xA;&gt; flavors than English counterparts.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Ingredients:** Pale ale malt, typically American two-row. American hops,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; often but not always ones with a citrusy character. American ale&#xD;&#xA;&gt; yeast. Water can vary in sulfate content, but carbonate content should&#xD;&#xA;&gt; be relatively low. Specialty grains may add character and complexity,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; but generally make up a relatively small portion of the grist. Grains&#xD;&#xA;&gt; that add malt flavor and richness, light sweetness, and toasty or&#xD;&#xA;&gt; bready notes are often used (along with late hops) to differentiate&#xD;&#xA;&gt; brands.&#xD;&#xA;" />

There's no brewing (boiling) stage necessary in making mead. All of the fermentable sugar comes from the honey in mead, so you just mix honey with water (and whatever spices you want) and go directly to the fermenting stage.

I really love Heady Topper and I haven't yet had another DIPA that tastes similar. First, it's not that expensive. It's $3.75 for a 16 oz can. $14 for a 4-pack. You can get it at local bars, pubs, and restaurants for $5/can. Around $78 for a case (24 x 16oz cans). Compared to other DIPA of similar quality, it's not that expensive (sure if you compared it to macro lagers...)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's produced by a small family owned brewery that's went through 2 expansions which doubled their brewery in size each time over the last 2 years (cannery has only existed for 2 years, before that they brewed it at a brewpub until the brewpub was destroyed by Hurricane Irene). They are currently getting their paperwork finalized for construction of a second brewery which will expand their production even more than before.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For locals, it's not that difficult to acquire. If you visit Vermont and plan ahead, then you're sure to leave with a case or two.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think it's worth trading for, but just remember that there's no beer that's life changing. Just a lot of really good tasting beer.&#xD;&#xA;" />

Text="Yes, there are craft breweries in Iceland. There aren't that many, but with a population of only 300,000 people that's to be expected. The main ones are Einstök, Borg, Gædingur, and Ölvisholt. There's also Stedji and Kaldi, but these are less interesting. I felt Gædingur was a bit variable on quality. Note that none of these produce extreme beers. They focus more on drinkability.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Only Borg is in Reykjavik. I don't know if you can visit the brewery.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can't buy interesting beer in Icelandic supermarkets, because the alcohol limit is 2.25%. As far as I could tell, only 4 beers were available in supermarkets, all of them pale lagers. You have to go to Vinbudin. There's a branch in the Austurstræti in the city centre, but the one out in the Kringlan shopping center has a bigger selection.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Look for these bars in the Reykjavik city centre: Micro Bar, Cafe Laundromat, K-Bar, and 73. All of them on Austurstræti and Laugarvegur.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Edit:* I forgot to say what's the most unique/distinct beer. I'd say Borg Fenrir, which they describe &quot;tadreyktur IPA&quot;, meaning IPA smoked in the traditional Icelandic way. That is, it's smoked by burning sheep dung. (Seriously.) The smoke aroma is really unusual, but actually quite nice." />

I have a favorite from Mill Street in Canada; they make a great vanilla porter.  The caveat though is that I like coffee a lot, and many people averse to beer tend to have trouble with the intense flavors of different varieties of beer, such as extreme hoppiness, heavily malted barley, or, darkly roasted barley that make up stouts and porters.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You mentioned less fruity beers, but talked about &quot;Wild Blue&quot; when you mentioned that.  Wild Blue is a Blueberry flavored lager; it's basically a &quot;regular beer,&quot; but is infused with blueberry flavor to change it up.  I would look at other &quot;fruity&quot; styles that are still very authentic and internationally renowned, but pack less of a general beer flavor than a filtered rice/grain/barley beer would...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A good starter would be a more heavily wheat based beer.  Styles like Belgian wheats or German hefeweizens have less of that pronounced &quot;regular beer&quot; flavor, but are still in their own right, very prolific styles.  I tend to find Belgian wheats/&quot;weisse/wittes(whites)&quot; to be a bit more &quot;chewy&quot; with more of a banana/coriander flavor than their full blown German counterparts.  Good wheats that I would recommend would be Franziskaner or Hoegaarden.  They're safe forays into that style of beer that I almost always tend to get for new drinkers.  The cool thing is that if she likes them, you can really experiment with other varieties in that field.  Belgian doubles and triples tend to generally fall into a similar category, and they're arguably some of the finest beers in the world..." />

Common bacteria involved are *Pediococcus acidilactici* and and *Lactobacillus* which *Tasting Beer* describes as having a buttery or &quot;goaty, sweat socks&quot; like aroma/flavor.  I think that probably aligns pretty closely with your &quot;musty&quot; description.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is it serious?  In the sense that it can cause illness, no, at least not these organisms.  These are probiotic bacteria similar to what are advertised in some yogurt.

Zare, the Professor of Natural Sciences at Stanford. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;But countless drinkers have claimed that the bubbles actually go down the side of the glass. Could they be right, or would that defy the laws of physics?&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In 1999, Australian researchers announced that they had created a computer model showing it was  possible for beer bubbles to flow downward.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But Zare and former Stanford post doctoral fellow Andrew J. Alexander were unconvinced by the virtual Guinness model and decided to put it to the test by analysing it physically.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;Indeed, Andy and I first disbelieved this and wondered if the people had had maybe too much Guinness to drink,&quot; Zare recalled. &quot;We tried our own experiments, which were fun but inconclusive. So Andy got hold of a camera that takes 750 frames a second and recorded some rather gorgeous video clips of what was happening.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A careful analysis of the video confirmed findings: Beer bubbles do sink.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;The answer turns out to be really very simple. It's based on the idea of what goes up has to come down. In this case, the bubbles go up more easily in the centre of the beer glass than on the sides because of drag from the walls. As they go up, they raise the beer, and the beer has to spill back, and it does. It runs down the sides of the glass carrying the bubbles -- particularly little bubbles -- with it, downward. After a while it stops, but it's really quite dramatic and it's easy to demonstrate.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The phenomenon also occurred in other beers, said Alexander&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;The bubbles are small enough to be pushed down by the liquid. We've shown you can do this with any liquid, really -- water with a fizzing tablet in it, for example.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;It's just paying attention to the world around you and trying to figure out why things happen the way they do...&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Source][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://news.stanford.edu/pr/2004/bubbles317.html" />

It was horrific, but hearing the descriptions my fellow drinkers came up with and having the brewer explaining the history of the hop really anchored it to me.

The micro- and homebrewing scene has been budding nicely in the last few years, the latest player being Steðji (founded in 2012).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## The Breweries ##&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In a category of their own are [Borg][1] and [Einstök][2]. These two operate under the wing of the two &quot;large&quot; local breweries (Víking and Egils), serving as their respective experimental departments. These two keep up a steady stream of new beers each year.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other microbreweries are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [Bruggsmiðjan][3]. Founded in 2006, they are the oldest microbrewery in Iceland (yup). They produce a line of Czech-style lagers, brand name Kaldi. Keep an eye out for seasonal variants. They have a deal with a bar in downtown Reykjavík, called Kaldi bar.&#xD;&#xA; - [Gæðingur][4]. They cover the big names in beer styles, producing a stout, an IPA, a wheat beer, etc. Their associated bar in downtown Reykjavík is Micro Bar.&#xD;&#xA; - [Steðji][5]. Their lineup is a mix of very normal German-style lagers and some truly wacky stuff - for instance, their [infamous *whale beer*, Hvalur][6].&#xD;&#xA; - [Ölvisholt][7]. They seem to rely on beers that don't quite fit into the more known styles to a greater degree than the others. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At the time of writing, this list should be exhaustive.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Selected products ##&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Off the top of my head, here are a few items I consider distinctive - or at least, I have not found anything *quite* like them abroad.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Einstök Arctic Berry Ale. Flavored with Icelandic berries.&#xD;&#xA; - Fenrir. An IPA smoked with sheep dung.&#xD;&#xA; - Garún. Imperial stout, more heavy on the licorice than most.&#xD;&#xA; - Lava. A smoked imperial stout.&#xD;&#xA; - Snorri. An ale spiced with Icelandic thyme.&#xD;&#xA; - And always, keep an eye out for seasonal variants.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## General beer buying advisory ##&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You **won't** buy Icelandic beers in the supermarket. The things that look like beers in those shelves are non-alcoholic versions. To buy beers, you must go to one of the state-operated [&quot;Wine stores&quot;][12].

I am somewhat aware of the evolution of the UK brewing industry, but nowhere near as knowledgeable as I am about America's.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, definitions.  Craft Beer commonly derives the Brewer's Association definition of a Craft Brewer.  Which is Small, Independent, Traditional.  Sparing the specifics it's a definition meant to exclude the world's largest brewing companies, and their &quot;crafty&quot; portfolios.  &quot;Crafty&quot; is a pejorative used to describe brands or brewers which may or may not produce good tasting beer, but are owned by the larger brands in attempts to diversify their portfolios.  While the BA is primarily focused on the American market, it seems most European writers defer to their terms.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Real Ale, is a distinctly British term.  Coined by CAMRA in the 70's it's more to do with the packaging and serving of the beer in the pub than the business scale of the brewer.  All Real Ale has to do is be cask conditioned and served via a gravity tap or hand-pulled with a beer engine.  This excludes a majority of what we in the US would consider craft beer, because it excludes anything kegged, filtered, force carbonated, or pushed with pressurized gas.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This leads to an interesting overlap where an unfiltered beer, carbonated by natural fermentation, could NOT be a real ale because it was kegged and served on gas.  Also, nothing prevents a large brand like Murphy's or Beamish (both owned by Heineken) from marketing a &quot;Real Ale&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These definitions aside: It sounds like you may just be an IPA fan.  Your craft beer list is entirely IPAs.  It's not really accurate to conflate Craft and IPAs because plenty of craft beers are stouts, rye beers, Scotch ales, English bitters, or totally non-traditional things.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another issue you might have with &quot;Real Ale&quot; is a technical note.  Because it's exposed to oxygen as soon as the cask is tapped real ale tends to spoil if it's not drank quickly.  The characteristic tastes of oxidized beer are cardboard, and the characteristic tastes of beer left on dead yeast for way too long is soapy.  I can easily see that coming off as &quot;waxy&quot;, especially if it's warmer than you're used to drinking and you've just downed some IPAs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Beer today is probably the best its ever tasted because of refinements in production techniques and farming.  Consumers are becoming interested in what their beer is made of so the quality of ingredients and care on a whole is improving.  But real ale is a niche,  there are going to be great traditional brewers making phenomenal beer, but it's prone to spoilage if not treated well.  There may also be those using it as a marketing gimmick.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And finally a last point about industrialization:  It has vastly improved the quality of ingredient and process that all brewers use.  The huge brands we now have, all started off as craft at one point.  But if they are no longer craft they either couldn't weather the market and faced the choice of no longer being a company or selling to a business and risk becoming more about business than beer.  In the US we have large breweries proving you can still be pretty big and make good beer.  Sam Adams, Stone Brewing, Dogfish Head, Yuengling, are HUGE by craft standards and haven't compromised the quality of their ingredients because brewers are still in charge.  Industrialization will never prevent a brewery lead by a passionate brewer from making interesting beer, but leaving brewing decisions up to a business man will always making boring beer." />

Similarly, the weight of the non-alcohol component will be `1 - abv` (assuming it has a density of 1).  So the total weight of the liquid will be:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;      0.789 * abv + (1 - abv)&#xD;&#xA;    = 1 - 0.211 * abv&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Using the weight of alcohol and the total weight, we can easily determine the alcohol-by-weight (also expressed as a number between 0 and 1):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    abw = 0.789 * abv / (1 - 0.211 * abv)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So this is clearly not linear (it is [hyperbolic][1]), and maintains identity for the 0% and 100% cases as expected.  We can invert the equation in a few steps:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;                        0.789 * abv = abw * (1 - 0.211 * abv)&#xD;&#xA;                        0.789 * abv = abw - 0.211 * abv * abw&#xD;&#xA;    0.789 * abv + 0.211 * abv * abw = abw&#xD;&#xA;        (0.789 + 0.211 * abw) * abv = abw&#xD;&#xA;                                abv = abw / (0.789 + 0.211 * abw)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So that confirms the formula you derived.

They have a sedating effect similar to alcohol and one may not feel one hundred percent alert while others may feel extremely sedated and unable to perform tasks that require attention and precision. For all this, there is always a warning about mixing alcohol with those drugs. However, effects vary a lot and you may get away with drinking and taking an SSRI such as Fluoxetine, Paroxetine or Sertraline. With a Benzodiazepine (Alprazolam, Clonazepam, Diazepam) you have to be more careful.  These drugs are more sedating than antidepressants and you may feel nothing, you may feel dizzy, or you may fall sound asleep.  One never knows for sure, so you gotta be careful. And do not drink and drive, even if you haven't taken any of these drugs. " />

Cock ale was obviously a thing, which was beer that was fermented (or boiled) with a rooster in it.  Lots of beers would also have been strained through spruce post-boil which would've given them some wood or pine quality.  Lots of other flowers were often involved.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Check out George Washington's small beer recipe [here][1].  Though this is a poor transcription and a lot of folks agree that it should read &quot;Bran, Hops to taste&quot;, it's still clear that the grain is sort of a &quot;for taste, whatever you can spare&quot; thing while the molasses is the star of the show.  A lot of early drinks were like that, involving some sort of concentrated or burnt sugar in addition to grains, which generally weren't barley at the time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, in the most ideal case where you had access to the best beer you could find...it would be some form of brown ale or lighter porter.  Maybe an amber ale if you could find one that wasn't very hoppy.  The stable kilning process that enabled people to make pale malt wasn't really invented until the mid-1600's and wasn't very popular until the 1700s, so brewers in the 1600s would've used a sort of generic-y brown malt that might taste slightly burnt and premium beers may have been able to include some lighter malt that was much harder to make and find.  And it'd probably still have some molasses in it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.beerhistory.com/library/holdings/washingtonrecipe.shtml" />

Text="Beck's is a pale German pilsner brewed by Beck's Brewery headquartered in Bremen.  The actual beer you drank was likely brewed in St. Louis, however, as Beck's is wholly owned by AB InBev.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Pale Lagers as a style are usually straw colored, up to a light gold with a white head.  The flavor is very light and dry with only slight malty sweetness.  A little crisp hop bitterness without too much hop aroma.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most &quot;macrobrews&quot; will be somewhat similar, though the stock &quot;American&quot; variant of Pale Lager like Budweiser or Miller will have a corn sugar flavor to them and likely be a bit lighter in body.  Beck's claimed to adhere to the German Beer Purity Law which would prohibit the use of an adjunct like corn.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;St. Pauli Girl is a very similar beer, and I think is even brewed in the same town as the original Beck's.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you want to stick with imports just about any pale German lager is going to do it for you since it's a very traditional style.  Anything by Spaten, Hacker-Pschorr, or Weihenstephan is solid and usually pretty easy to get ahold of.  Pilsner-Urquell is also a great beer, but it's in the Pilsner style so while it's still a pale lager Pilsners can have a sulfur-y or buttery tinge due to the green bottles and slight diacetyl.  Pilsners also have a strong hop character and bitterness.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you wanted to try local or American brewed versions just about anyone's Session Lager (Full Sail comes to mind, as does Notch if you're near MA at all) should be similar.  According to [this list][1] on BeerAdvocate you should be near Berghoff and Baderbrau which will both make traditional German styles.  Some breweries, Baderbrau included, will call their pale lager a &quot;Lawnmower beer&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Branching out, Sam Adams Boston Lager is a style called Vienna Lager which may also appeal you.  Though it will be significantly maltier than Beck's.  Anything with Dortmunder in the name will also be similar, though hoppier but not like an American Pale Ale or IPA or anything.  You might also be interested in any brewery's Cream Ale, which is an Ale version of the Pale Lager style.  Kolsch style beers may also appeal to you since they share the same light body and slight maltiness.  Kolsch's are hybrid beers which are fermented warm like an Ale would be, but then cold conditioned like a Lager.  Officially Kolsch can only be brewed in Cologne, Germany, but many American breweries will make a Kolsch style since it drinks really well in the summer and provides more flavor variety than pale lager or Cream Ale.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Does that help?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.beeradvocate.com/place/city/6/" />

It's a very bland beer that's stored on American bourbon casks for a while. This gives it a strong, perfumy vanilla aroma. Some people think it feels artificial, but it's really not. It's the aroma of the American oak. Given that your friend loves vanilla it seems the obvious place to start.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Duchesse du Bourgogne** is technically a Flemish red. It's a sweetish beer that's been stored in wooden barrels so that it turns a little acidic, too. Kind of fruity, kind of vinous, little bitterness. It's really a classic beer, and while many men love it (me among them), even more women seem to like it. Really worth trying.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**German weissbier** is sweetish, not sour, not at all bitter, and has a gentle banana flavour that comes from the yeast. Again it's something that many men like, and more women. Good examples are Weihenstephaner, Paulaner, and Erdinger (in that order). US wheat ale might work, too, but they generally use normal ale yeast and thus turn deathly boring.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Belgian witbier** is similar to the weissbier, even though it uses a more neutral yeast, but then makes up for it with orange peel and coriander. Hoegaarden is the original, but there are many more examples you could try.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Belgian beer** in general is sweet and low on bitterness. Some good ones to try: Westmalle Trippel, Barbar, Chimay White, La Trappe (legally Dutch), Rochefort, St Bernardus.

In the Middle Ages?  Where?  When?  These are important questions.  Lumping around a thousand years and very different cultural eras (ranging from the Vendell-era Norse to the Byzantine Empire) into the same label is problematic at the very least.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The answer I think to the question as stated has to be &quot;no&quot; insofar as there were times and places in the Middle Ages where beer was a clear luxury (early medieval Iceland comes to mind).  Similarly, it isn't always clear that beer was universally consumed by the lower classes in much of the Middle Ages (though certainly towards the end it became more common).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Example 1:  Anglo-Saxon England**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This being said, beer was an important dietary staple in much (though not all!) of medieval Europe at least among monks, merchants, and the upper classes.  Heavier beers were used as bread substitutes.  For the common man in Anglo-Saxon England, though, even bread was a luxury  and most grains were cooked into gruel, porridge, either with or without fracturing (think of bulgur wheat).  This would then be supplemented with vegetables, eggs, dairy, and sometimes meat (even for the serfs, at least in Anglo-Saxon England, meat was not out of the question).  Well water was the primary source of hydration in this era (again see Hagen, below), and laws were passed to ensure that drinking water directly from someone else's well was protected, legal activity (in other words, a well owner could restrict what people could take away from the well, but not what they could drink on the spot).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If we separate out the lower classes and the areas where beer was not commonly available (Iceland, for example) the picture changes dramatically.  Beer was very common, but not at all a homogeneous beverage.  Bald's Leechbook (10th Century, Anglo-Saxon) contains the warning that while &quot;*ealu*&quot; (-&gt; ale) may be consumed by pregnant women, &quot;*beor*&quot; (-&gt; beer) causes miscarriage.  Identifying these beverages is problematic. Ann Hagen (&quot;Anglo-Saxon Food and Drink&quot;) suggests that &quot;beor&quot; must have been a strong mead instead of a malt liquor based on descriptions of specific gravity (she calculates a minimum alcohol content of around 20%).  If it was a strong mead, it may have been further supplemented by herbs like mugwort, henbane, and hops, and therefore even more problematic than a strong mead might be.  In this case, it would have been fermented grains would have been certainly consumed by children and pregnant women.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Interestingly the traditional fermented rice and cassava dishes here in Indonesia are acceptable to serve to children too.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Sources on history**:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1.  Hagen, Ann.  &quot;*Anglo-Saxon Food and Drink*&quot;&#xD;&#xA;2.  Pollington, Stephen.  &quot;*Leechcraft*&quot; (for an edition of Bald's Leechbook with facing page translation).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Example 2:  Medieval Iceland**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The early Icelandic settlers tried to grow barley for beer with only very limited success.  Alcoholic beverages were thus very much a luxury item, and usually if someone was going to have it (going mostly by medieval saga evidence as ethnography), it was going to be someone who had gone viking and returned with a fair bit of wealth.  A second point though is that Icelandic society recognized about three levels of society (*godhi*, *bondi*, and *thrall*) based on relationship to certain kinds of property:  a *godhi* (priest-attorney-legislator-jurist) owned a *godhord* (the office was property and could be sold, loaned, or even put into partnership property).  A *bondi* (free juryman) owned land.  And a *thrall* was owned (though the actual requirements would have been more like early serfdom than slavery due to a lack of central administration and enforcement).  In addition to successful bondi-turned-vikings, you would have had the fact that a godhi had sufficient economic benefits from office to likely be able to afford alcoholic beverages at least sometimes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In Iceland, drinking was usually a social action and as far as the existing evidence goes would have been a specifically male activity limited to the sorts of ritualized drinking portrayed in Beowulf (such ritualized drinking is portrayed in the Volsung Saga, Egill's Saga, Njall's Saga, and many many others).  Drunkenness was warned against in the literature, and there are very interesting questions of what else was put in the beverages, since poisoning was a pretty clear concern in the literature (Eddic poems such as Havamal and Sigdrifumal speak to both these concerns).  From archaeological evidence from &quot;continental&quot; Scandinavia, we may surmise henbane was common, and this may to some extent play into the references to military drinking in Hrolf Kraki's Saga.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In short, in Iceland, as far as we can tell, beer and mead would have been limited to far more ritualized roles (reinforcing social obligations, certain forms of oaths, etc).  Literature on women and alcohol is very sparse.  It's probable that the bride drank at the wedding as part of making the wedding official.  There's a lot of uncertainty beyond this however in terms of attitudes towards pregnancy and alcohol.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Further reading:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* the various sagas referenced above.&#xD;&#xA;* The *Poetic Edda* (I usually recommend the Hollander translation if you are going to work in translation because he tends to be transparent about which emendations he is using).&#xD;&#xA;* Byock, Jesse:  *Viking-Age Iceland*&#xD;&#xA;* Byock, Jesse:  *Medieval Iceland*&#xD;&#xA;* Roesdahl, Else: *The Vikings*&#xD;&#xA;* Pollington, Stephen: *Leechcraft* (for some archaeological discussions of Scandinavian forts and brewing)." />

There's been big debates over to what degree they were aware that water caused diseases while beer did not, but a big factor was that beer was seen as nourishing (which it is) while water was not. In an age where getting enough to eat was a recurring challenge, this contributed to making people prefer beer/wine. In practice it seems people preferred alcoholic drinks for both reasons.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Generally, people would drink small beer as an everyday drink against thirst (and that's what children got, too), and beer proper for celebrations. That's actually a Finnish saying: &quot;small beer for work, beer for celebration&quot; (&quot;Kaljalla työt tehdään, oluella pidot pidetään&quot;).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Small beer was generally made together with beer. That is, they'd do a mash, and the first wort that's run off has the most sugar. As you keep pouring water through, obviously more and more sugar is washed out of the malts, and the wort keeps getting waterier. Eventually they'd stop, and make beer from the wort. Then they'd continue, and run off a much weaker wort from the remaining sugar in the malts. This was the small beer. Many places they would even do a third beer, which was so weak it would barely ferment. There were also other grain-based drinks, made from flour or bread, and typically sour and just barely alcoholic. Kvass is the best-known example, but there were many others.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Weak beer as an every-day drink continued for much longer than you might think. It was the introduction of tea/coffee that first started displacing it. Then, later, higher availability of milk, then juices and soft drinks continued the process. On Gotland, off the coast of Sweden, children were drinking weak beer as late as the 1960s. I lack data for exactly when this ended elsewhere, but it was long, long after the Middle Ages." />

I'm on my third keg and i am still having problems. I tapped the keg on Christmas Day after leaving it for 24 hours. Temp is 39, pressure is 12 running a 5ft line. It poured great for the first day, with the occasional foamy pull. The next day we noticed the keg was leaking from the coupler. I cleaned it up reconnected the coupler and had little pressure. I added an o ring and let it sit. The pressure came back and it doesn't leak, but every pull is 90% foam. I let it sit for another day, dropping the pressure to 10 and releasing the pressure value on the coupler. Still foam...what gives...it was working well.&#xD;&#xA;Can anyone give me some suggestions.

From Daniels:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Using all these techniques … the big guys only control their bitterness to within plus or minus 2 IBU! Given that the average level of bitterness might be something like 15 IBUs, that represents an allowable variation of 13 percent in the bitterness of the product. The reason [major producers] don't sweat over the IBU inside that range is because the human palate can't detect the difference. Studies have shown that the detection threshold for bitterness is about 5 IBU. And that is for beers in the 10 to 15 IBU range.

An interest in the history and production of these beers is best served by Phil Markowski's _Farmhouse Ales_ and Stan Hieronymus' _Brew Like a Monk_.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To touch on a few of your questions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- As previously alluded, beer served a utilitarian purpose as a dietary staple and nutritional supplement for an agrarian society. Beer was frequently brewed in large batches at regular intervals in support of farm life, and the result were table beers and saisons for work during the harvest and *bières de garde* (loosely translated: &quot;beers for keeping&quot;) to survive the winters. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Abbey ales are not as varied as they initially appear. Much of the variation in beers brewed in Trappist style come from fermenting different &quot;runnings&quot; of the beer; to summarize *very* briefly, the strength is dependent upon the sugar content which is dependent on how many saccharifications the malt has already undergone. See Wikipedia's page on [lautering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lautering) for more details.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Belgian and English brewing are actually *not* very dissimilar from a historical perspective, and there was quite a bit of overlap in technique between English, Belgian, and Flandrian brewers. The differences in style we perceive now (e.g. IPAs vs Flemish sours) evolved by regional taste preferences from common roots: malt-forward beers (which were originally quite sour) using the low alpha acid noble hops which thrived on the continent. Consider the similarities in taste and composition between an ESB and a dubbel.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition to the above referenced works, a quick read through the history section of Jeff Sparrow's _Wild Brews_ should answer any remaining questions you might have about the history of Franco-Belgian beer." />

Text="When one speaks of &quot;Belgian brewing&quot;, one must distinguish between two major styles of beer: the famous abbey ales produced by Trappist orders in Belgium (and now one in America), and the the saisons and bières de garde produced as inexpensive nutritional supplements and dietary staples for farm life. An interest in the history and production of these beers is best served by Phil Markowski's _Farmhouse Ales_ and Stan Hieronymus' _Brew Like a Monk_.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To touch on a few of your questions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- As previously alluded, beer served a utilitarian purpose as a dietary staple and nutritional supplement for an agrarian society. Beer was frequently brewed in large batches at regular intervals in support of farm life, and the result were table beers and saisons for work during the harvest and *bières de garde* (loosely translated: &quot;beers for keeping&quot;) to survive the winters. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Abbey ales are not as varied as they initially appear. Much of the variation in beers brewed in Trappist style come from fermenting different &quot;runnings&quot; of the same batches of wort (unfermented beer); to summarize *very* briefly, the strength is dependent upon the sugar content which is dependent on how many saccharifications the malt has already undergone. See Wikipedia's page on [lautering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lautering) for more details.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Belgian and English brewing are actually *not* very dissimilar from a historical perspective, and there was quite a bit of overlap in technique between English, Belgian, and Flandrian brewers. The differences in style we perceive now (e.g. IPAs vs Flemish sours) evolved by regional taste preferences from common roots: malt-forward beers (which were originally quite sour) using the low alpha acid noble hops which thrived on the continent. Consider the similarities in taste and composition between an ESB and a dubbel.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition to the above referenced works, a quick read through the history section of Jeff Sparrow's _Wild Brews_ should answer any remaining questions you might have about the history of Franco-Belgian beer." />

So, it is certainly possible to remain consistent from bottle to draught, though it is less common and more costly to do so.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Both bottled and draught beers use nitrogen to add bubbles instead of CO2 on occasion. This is more common with malty beers, say stouts and porters, than it is for hoppy beers. The nitrogen makes smaller bubbles than CO2, and creates a thick head due to the lower solubility of nitrogen in water than CO2 at the same temperatures. This creates the thicker mouthfeel that Guinness (as well as other nitrogenated stouts) are known for. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;CO2 will likely continue to be used for most hop-forward beers, since it pushes more aroma out of the beer (including the delicious hop scent!) while nitro is more about the mouthfeel and well-rounded flavor.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A few reasons why other beers don't use the small nitrogen ball devices (&quot;nitrogen widgets&quot;):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Alcohol laws (or FDA or something?) doesn’t allow craft brewers to add&#xD;&#xA;&gt; widgets/foreign objects to alcohol (cans).

Beck's uses roasted hops and has a more bitter earthy flavor with much less foam.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The flavor of other &quot;light lagers&quot; (european pilsners) may be similar, however, a German pilsner is much easier to drink because, unlike most other light lager beers, a true pilsner is much less filling and has much less foam. German pilsners are noted for &quot;drinkability&quot;. Beck's can be consumed with a large meal and then consumed afterwards as well. I believe this is why many non beer drinkers prefer and enjoy Beck's and almost no other beer. [Click here for a list of &quot;German style pilsners&quot; as well as a list of the other types of similar beers and what makes them different][1] Light lagers such as Heinekin, Stella, Amstel, etc ... are &quot;European pilsner&quot; beers typically labeled as lager whereas a German pilsner beer is typically labeled &quot;pilsner&quot; or &quot;pils&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Heineken does produce a true pilsner variety][2] but it is not officially distributed or available within the United States. [Heineken lager][3] is distributed and sold throughout North America and has much more body and is more filling as one would expect from a light lager or &quot;european pilsner&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sam Adams Gold pilsner is described as having &quot;great body&quot;. This is not a characteristic of most German pilsners that are sharp and light bodied. This beeradvocate post goes on to say that [&quot;This is one of those beers to give to a Bud drinker&quot;][4] . . . definitely not something most people would say of Beck's. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Similar beers include: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[St Pauli Girl][5] **pilsner** (not to be confused with St Pauli Girl lager) is brewed for export only at the Beck's brewery in Bremen Germany.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Tsingtao][6], a Chinese brewed German pilsner. Tsingtao is a product of the German occupation of Qingdao from the late 1800s until 1914. Not quite a flavorful as Beck's because the original recipe has changed but still a German pilsner in many aspects. Tsingtao is widely available at many Asian restaurants throughout North America and is a much better alternative or substitute for Beck's than Heinekin or Stella.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Löwenbräu produces Beck's under licence for southern Germany and other parts of europe and is known for similar flavor (but then again, so is Heineken).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, [here is another list of German Pilsners.][7]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;Update:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you're going to go the way of sam adams, at least get the right kind of beer and not some awful american lager. [Sam Adams makes a Noble Pils.][8]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Noble hops are the type of hops German pilsners are distinct for, strong hops flavor.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even better is [Sixpoint crisp][10]. Strong hops flavor, easy to drink, and almost no hint of barley. More fruty than Beck's. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, [Pilsner Urquell][11] has a bit more foam than I would like from a German beer (probably because it's not German) but still did not weigh heavy on my stomach and easy to drink as well. Not quite as much flavor but I did not try the bottle.

Additionally, the ingredients you use aren't going to be exactly the same, and by far the biggest difference is likely to be in the water.  The mineral content in your water will be different from theirs, for instance, and this will have an effect on the flavor.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, brewing beer shouldn't be able slavishly replicating something you find on the store shelves...It should be about experimenting until you find the recipe that is perfect for your particular tastes.

Text="When one speaks of &quot;Belgian brewing&quot;, one must distinguish between two major styles of beer: the famous abbey ales produced by Trappist orders in Belgium (and now one in America), and the the saisons and bières de garde produced as inexpensive nutritional supplements and dietary staples for farm life. An interest in the history and production of these beers is best served by Phil Markowski's _Farmhouse Ales_ and Stan Hieronymus' _Brew Like a Monk_.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To touch on a few of your questions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- As previously alluded, beer served a utilitarian purpose as a dietary staple and nutritional supplement for an agrarian society. Beer was frequently brewed in large batches at regular intervals in support of farm life, and the result were table beers and saisons for work during the harvest and *bières de garde* (loosely translated: &quot;beers for keeping&quot;) to survive the winters. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Abbey ales are not as varied as they initially appear. Much of the variation in beers brewed in Trappist style come from fermenting different &quot;runnings&quot; of the same batches of wort (unfermented beer); to summarize *very* briefly, the strength is dependent upon the sugar content which is dependent on how many times the mashed malt has been &quot;rinsed&quot;. See Wikipedia's page on [lautering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lautering) for more details.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Belgian and English brewing are actually *not* very dissimilar from a historical perspective, and there was quite a bit of overlap in technique between English, Belgian, and Flandrian brewers. The differences in style we perceive now (e.g. IPAs vs Flemish sours) evolved by regional taste preferences from common roots: malt-forward beers (which were originally quite sour) using the low alpha acid noble hops which thrived on the continent. Consider the similarities in taste and composition between an ESB and a dubbel.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition to the above referenced works, a quick read through the history section of Jeff Sparrow's _Wild Brews_ should answer any remaining questions you might have about the history of Franco-Belgian beer." />

In this way, they're very similar to amber ale/lagers, and the difference can be very subtle and is very subjective. If you like one, you'll 99% of the time enjoy the other. Most of what you mentioned- like Dos Equis and Yuengling- are marketed as ambers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, I looked up Honest Lager, and Walkerville markets it as Märzen (sometimes but not always the same as Oktoberfest) It's less hoppy and more full-bodied than a Pils or other pale lager, and tends to be reddish or amber in color. If you look a the German/import section of your local beer store or supermarket, you should be able to find an example of something similar, just look for the words &quot;Märzen,&quot; &quot;Oktoberfest,&quot; &quot;Festbier,&quot; etc. A Munich-style Dunkel would also probably be right up your alley. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Key words I would use: sweetish, medium-bodied, balanced, caramelly, toasty. But just think about different foods and aromas while you're drinking, and see what your impression is. Everybody's different.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you do want to use the BJCP guide, just remember that they're designed for judging homebrew competitions, and professional brewers don't have much reason to pay attention to them.

What's the difference? Generally, the &quot;American&quot; prefix at the start of any beer style means that it's hoppier, due to our lovefest with hops (at least compared to the Old World).

The GABF can have real reputation and financial influence for a brewery, so it requires very precise definitions, but outside of competitions most of the brewing world takes the BJCP with a grain of salt (or is it a grain of barley?). Personally, I prefer the Ratebeer and Beer Advocate's style categorizations. Not that they are perfect either - part of the beauty of craft beer is that it is ever-evolving, and brewer creativity knows no category bounds - but it is more democratic and reflective of actual market tastes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you are willing to go a little further afield, you might try a Scottish Ales, like Founders Dirty Bastard (www.ratebeer.com/beer/founders-dirty-bastard-scotch-ale/11498/); a Red IPA (not an official style) such as Troegs Nugget Nectar (www.ratebeer.com/beer/troegs-nugget-nectar-ale/30812/); or even a Bière de Garde, France's only indigenous beer style (these are harder to find, but I bet they have them in Montreal. try www.ratebeer.com/beerstyles/biere-de-garde/58/ or www.beeradvocate.com/beer/style/127/.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't if StackExchange encourages one to share ones credentials, but I am a Certified Cicerone and spent two years running a craft beer ecommerce company called Beer Dreamer." />

I'd believe that.  Beer from a brewery's tap is likely incredibly fresh, which most people would agree for most styles is better.  Especially with how popular hoppy beers are in the San Diego scene, hops fade quickly...fresher will be way more aromatic.  The beer you buy in the store may have been filtered or pasteurized, has been bottled and then sat in a warehouse for a while before being trucked around the county and then sitting on a shelf for a while before you hauled it back home.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, is there an objective way to express &quot;Fresher is better&quot;?  Dunno, probably not.  You could run lab analysis and try to point at alpha and beta acid numbers, volatile organic oils or something...but it almost seems like trying to cobble together a theory after having made the conclusions already.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The BJCP was mentioned in another answer.  What BJCP is, is an attempt to apply objective qualitative judgment to taste, which is inherently subjective, by asking folks to compare what they're sensing to an ideal example.  Basically &quot;How closely does this beer I'm tasting now adhere to description of the style of beer it's supposed to be?&quot;  They'll generally look at &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Head: color, density, how long it lasts. &#xD;&#xA; - Aroma: malty? hoppy? spicy? grassy? sulphury? &#xD;&#xA; - Visual: color, clarity &#xD;&#xA; - Feel: thickness on the tongue, fizziness, acidity...&#xD;&#xA; - Taste: malty, hoppy, spicy... balanced?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What you _COULD_ theoretically do is drink the beer at the brewery, and then describe as if it was a BJCP description, then drink the beer from the store and grade it according to how close it resembles the brewery beer in those categories.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Outside of that, everything is subjective.  What you feel like drinking, right now.  The beer best suited to the weather will change with each season, beers best suited to the evening will change with what you're having for dinner.

RB users tend to be more heavily biased by the idea that certain breweries aren't &quot;cool&quot;, while BA users tend to be more objective).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is always the BJCP guide, which makes the rules that guide most homebrewing and professional contests such as the GABF. The GABF can have real reputation and financial influence for a brewery, so it requires very precise definitions, but outside of competitions most of the brewing world takes the BJCP with a grain of salt (or is it a grain of barley?). Personally, I prefer the Ratebeer and Beer Advocate's style categorizations. Not that they are perfect either - part of the beauty of craft beer is that it is ever-evolving, and brewer creativity knows no category bounds - but it is more democratic and reflective of actual market tastes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you are willing to go a little further afield, you might try a Scottish Ales, like Founders Dirty Bastard (www.ratebeer.com/beer/founders-dirty-bastard-scotch-ale/11498/); a Red IPA (not an official style) such as Troegs Nugget Nectar (www.ratebeer.com/beer/troegs-nugget-nectar-ale/30812/); or even a Bière de Garde, France's only indigenous beer style (these are harder to find, but I bet they have them in Montreal. try www.ratebeer.com/beerstyles/biere-de-garde/58/ or www.beeradvocate.com/beer/style/127/." />

Long story short, as Europe was going through a technology renaissance period, ingredients used for brewing changed and grains that were converted into malt became lighter. Therefore, dramatically changing the &quot;beer&quot;, that was much darker at that time, now into and ale. As this changed the palettes of many at that time they also introduced a great amount of fresh hops to these new ales to make a strongly hopped ale. The term IPA was introduced as a well known brewer(s) started shipping this new type of beer to India, giving it the distinct name IPA-India Pale Ale.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am providing this back ground to make a point. As this product was fermented, it was very typical to age and IPA Beer for a minimum of 1 year. This was done to assure that the beer was completely fermented and safe to transport on ships to India. This trip would take even more time and put the produced under various environmental stresses. This beer or &quot;ale&quot;, was hopped very strongly and even topping the very hoppiest beer on the market in the U.S. today. Using the freshest malt as well as the freshest hops.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My final point or argument is, that as I recreate the IPA and use fresh ingredients typical to a real IPA, I find that my IPA's last over a year in the bottle. As I drink them 3 to 6 and even 9 and 12 months the hoppy flavors still remain and even develop. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are many variables that allow me to get to this end result. This including yeast and malt selection, and also multiple methods that help produce beneficial fermentation, allowing the taste of the final product to be clear of flaws that would be created by the yeast during primary as well as the bottling (carbonation) period.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;After 30 years of beer making many of these truths become evident as I continually taste the final product, take very good notes and adjust my recipe.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, I can say that with the correct procedure of beer making, an IPA can be enjoyed at various stages from 1 week and even up to one year and can still be enjoyed for its distinct hop flavor and aroma.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  " />

I'll give you two answers:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1) There is no way to determine that a beer is objectively better than another beer. Why? Because taste in beer is subjective.

So, is it really true that [x] is a better beer than [y] if person [c] can like [y] better than [x]?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2) There is a way to determine beers that are subjectively better than another. Check out beeradvocate.com which has a mass of users rating beers in all walks of styles on different criteria.

An expensive option is the [Blichman Hoprocket](http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/blichmann-hoprocket.html). Another option I've seen, but I'm not sure how to construct it, was an inline water filter that had been modified. That modified filter also required significantly more CO2 to maintain pressure, I don't think that was true of the purpose built devices.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These work well for fresh flavors, but would serve poorly if you were looking for anything else.

These two operate under the wing of the two &quot;large&quot; local breweries (Víking and Egils), serving as their respective experimental departments. These two keep up a steady stream of new beers each year.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other microbreweries are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [Bruggsmiðjan][3]. Founded in 2006, they are the oldest microbrewery in Iceland (yup). They produce a line of Czech-style lagers, brand name Kaldi. Their products can usually be found at the appropriately named Kaldi bar in downtown Reykjavík.&#xD;&#xA; - [Gæðingur][4]. They cover the big names in beer styles, producing a stout, an IPA, a wheat beer, etc. Their associated bar in downtown Reykjavík is Micro Bar.&#xD;&#xA; - [Steðji][5]. Their lineup is a mix of very normal German-style lagers and some truly wacky stuff - for instance, their [infamous *whale beer*, Hvalur][6].&#xD;&#xA; - [Ölvisholt Brugghús][7] (ÖB). Their beers are a bit all over the place, seemingly preferring to create beer they like to creating house variants of the common styles.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At the time of writing, this list should be exhaustive.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Selected products ##&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Off the top of my head, here are a few items I consider distinctive - or at least, I have not found anything *quite* like them abroad.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Garún. Imperial stout, more heavy on the licorice than most.&#xD;&#xA; - Lava. A smoked imperial stout.&#xD;&#xA; - Snorri. An ale spiced with Icelandic thyme.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And always, keep an eye out for seasonal beers. The breweries usually allow themselves more creative freedom on those products. Last year (2014), we saw beers like the Einstök Arctic Berry Ale (beer flavored with Icelandic berries), Fenrir (an IPA smoked with sheep dung) and Hvalur (the whale beer mentioned earlier).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## General beer buying advisory ##&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You **won't** buy Icelandic beers in the supermarket.

My guess is it would have been good for longer, but tasty beer and curiosity got the best of my experiment. I think Wayne in Yak deserves an up vote I can't yet do thanks to my noob status. Well researched and void of conjectural inaccuracy. If hops were the only flavor in IPA then yes it could be decreasingly &quot;hoppy&quot; but that's assuming we're referring to the aroma hops. Your bittering hops would surely deepen with time. But with any beer there are more layers than one. High ABV beers will just broaden the chord change more as every flavor will carry different in the changing alcohol/water/sugar levels that time provides. Fruit in the beer no matter its place on the sweet/sour spectrum (notably normally high point as well) have similar success on the &quot;cool dark&quot; shelf. This is due to natural fermentation of organic matter  stored over time. Ever noticed how fresh salsa gets effervescent in your fridge? Granted there are no chunks of fruit (or tomatoes luckily) in your beer so the effects are severely lessened. They weigh in on the scale equal to the alcohol changes mentioned above. A personal favorite of mine is a Scotch Ale stored for as long as you can wait. Hope this helps." />

After Pasteur showed that yeast are responsible for fermentation, the Carlsberg brewery isolated *S. carlsbergensis*, now known as *S. pastorianus*, for commercial use. This is a lager yeast, and since many ales were brewed with mixed (*S cerevisiae* plus wild yeasts, bacteria) cultures, it created the perception was that lager, as a style, was cleaner than ale, and the improved shelf life made it a more attractive product to produce. And so, lagers took over the beer world after that, despite so many small breweries that make high quality ales. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Something like &quot;Organic&quot; or &quot;Kosher&quot; that comes with a set of regulated conditions that product was produced under.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Per [wikipedia][1], to be able to be labelled a Trappist beer:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The beer must be brewed within the walls of a Trappist monastery, either by the monks themselves or under their supervision.&#xD;&#xA; - The brewery must be of secondary importance within the monastery and it should witness to the business practices proper to a monastic way of life&#xD;&#xA; - The brewery is not intended to be a profit-making venture.

Having said this I usually like my beers a little colder on a warm summer day. Try this experiment:  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - chill your beer to 35-40 degrees and pour about 2/3 of it into the proper glass for that beer. &#xD;&#xA; - Drink at least 4 or 5 sips, gulps, or however you typically consume it. &#xD;&#xA; - Then put what is left in the microwave for about 20 seconds(time will vary with the output of the microwave).  This will reduce the carbonation some so pour the other third right in the middle of the glass without tipping the glass to get some head, on the beer that is. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It makes a big difference on some beers. less on others. Also try different types of glasses and see what you like. Remember, everybody's palates are different and yours will vary depending on several factors such as, what you've been eating or drinking, how much beer you've already consumed, and how tired you are. It's a good idea to eat a bite or two of good bread like a baguette to cleanse your palate between samples. The above does not apply to mass produced lagers." />

Lambics and other sour beers can go up to 4.5 volumes.  This is a linear scale so that becomes possibly twice as much pressure as a normal bottle...so yeah, thicker glass.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At such high pressure you might find corks will stay put more reliably than a cap since it has more surface area in contact with the bottle.  It also might provide a more airtight seal than a cap for long-term aging.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Those would be technical considerations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Corking also predated capping so there's also a very traditional feel about a bottle with a cork and a cage, which can fit into the traditional image a lot of breweries market themselves using.  I say I'm not sure and it could just be marketing because a lot of Wheat styles like German Wheats, Belgian Wits, etc are fairly highly carbonated (near the 3.3 volumes range) but most of them have no problems being capped.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As to the affect on taste?  Nada, apart from hypothetical aging concerns...unless mistreated you should not taste the cork." />

Many of the styles identified at higher carbonation volumes also come in capped bottles (particularly 375ml bottles). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Corks do provide a better seal that slows the flow of air into the beer so those bottles will age more slowly than bottles with caps. That is the primary technical difference between the two.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The primary reasons for corking beer today is marketing. In some areas where corked bottles were traditionally used for bottling it was easier to get champagne bottles or similar bottles that could support carbonation and corking became a matter of convenience as it was cheaper to source bottles locally. However, now it is just a matter of marketing the product. All other corked bottles went into large format, corked bottles to make them look like a classier product than a six pack and legitimize higher prices in the customers' eyes. That is true for the beers you find on the market today in almost all cases. Very few beers go into corked bottles because the brewer truly believes it is necessary for the long term quality of the beer in a way that a cap or a cap plus wax would not provide." />

Some of these are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Warm beer foams too much, if your server is dumping tons of head down the drain to fill your glass with enough beer it might be too warm.&#xD;&#xA; - Too much pressure in the keg makes beer foam too much.  The brewer carbonated it to the level they wanted, the bar might be over carbonating it.&#xD;&#xA; - Cold beer does not foam very much.  If the kegs are chilled too cold or the bar is serving beer in a frozen glass, your beer is probably too cold.  Cold dulls flavors and kills aromas, obviously if you're into beer for flavor, this is bad.&#xD;&#xA; - Dirty glasses tend to dissipate the foam very quickly, so you could be drinking whatever was in the glass before, or soap scum...neither of which sound very tasty.&#xD;&#xA; - Undercarbonated beer doesn't foam very much.  Undercarbonation can also dull flavors since so much of taste is based on smell and you can't smell volatile aromatics if there's no fizz to carry them out of the liquid.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are various schools of thought on the head as an indicator of beer's quality or freshness but realistically this will vary by style.  Think of the thick creamy head of Guinness stout, remove the head and you completely change the experience.  The large luxurious heads of Belgian beers, or the thinner off-color head of porters.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, without a good head with lots of tiny popping bubbles of CO2 to spray the air above the glass with volatile aromatic oils, you wouldn't have nearly as much hoppiness to smell and taste in an IPA or spices from a Belgian style.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://beer.stackexchange.com/questions/485/why-is-it-important-to-have-foam-on-a-beer" />

The carbon dioxide that forms the bubbles in the head is produced during fermentation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But what is the actual significance of focusing on the head of the beer so much? Why does one concern themselves with how much head exists, how long it lasts, etc?" />

When I got my girlfriend into beer I introduced her to particulars like 'St. Ambroise Apricot Ale' and a 'Fruli'. She had no idea that fruity, sweet beers like this existed, and after trying enough of them she became more of a beer person.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So in general spiced or sweet beers are usually a good direction to go, but it also depends on the person's tastes.

While they're both styles of dark beer nowadays Mild is very low ABV with a lot of malty/nutty flavors and fruity sweetness.  Stouts are stronger than milds with no fruitiness and a lot of roasted and burnt flavors instead of malts.  Most will probably be more bitter and have less residual sweetness than milds.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**The long answer is:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Historically stout and mild were completely unrelated terms that referred to completely different things than they wound up being known for.  Both started being used in the 18th century.  Stout originally just meant strong and Mild was used as the opposite of Keeping (or Stale), which basically just meant the beer was fresh rather than being aged in a barrel for any length of time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Mild turned into a strength descriptor in the early 19th century when brewers started using the X, XX, XXX system to classify their ales, which referred to both the ABV and pounds of hops per barrel.  But Mild was still a pale beer.  As the 20th century progressed Milds started becoming more amber colored and playing more as malty and sweet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All beers until this point were actually much stronger than we're used to today.  Barclay Perkins X Ale in 1839 was actually close to 8% ABV.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Grain shortages and government restrictions towards the end of WWI dropped Mild to close to 2%, and brewers also added dark sugars and mixed in amber and brown malt to keep some measure of flavor.  After the war ended ABVs bounced back up but new taxes in the 30s pushed them back down, close to the modern range for Mild.  Dark mild being the standard and Pale mild being a variant didn't really happen until the 1950s.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The history of stout is quite a bit muddier, though the general consensus seems to be that it evolved out of Stout Brown Porter and has been largely interchangeable with Porter for most of its history.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The differentiation probably started with in the invention of Black Patent Malt in 1817.  In the late 1700s new technology had been invented that allowed brewers to track their efficiency and they realized the roasty brown malt they used for porters was really expensive compared to how much fermentable sugar it produced. So they started making porters out of mostly pale malt with brown malt and burnt sugars among other ingredients for color and flavor.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Britain had banned the use of anything besides malted barley in brewing in 1816 which really kindof screwed porter brewers over.  With Black Patent they had something which was absurdly dark enough that they could finally make up the color difference using pale malt.  Though most brewers in England continued to use some portion of brown malt, brewers in Ireland switched completely to pale and black malts only.  Irish beer was also less hoppy than English beer in general since hops didn't grow as well in Ireland.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Guinness renamed its XX Porter to Extra Stout Porter in ~1820 and the popularity and marketing gradually dropped &quot;Porter&quot; from the name, which is probably where Stout began to evolve as a style separate from Porter.  But it's in a bit of grey area, people in 2015 are still debating Porter vs Stout.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Short version of the long story**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Mild originally just meant Fresh and as a style evolved from the weakest pale beer a brewery made, and only really became what we think of it as today in the last 60 years.  Stout originally just meant Strong and was a synonym for Porter for a very long time until marketing tried to differentiate it maybe 150 years ago.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sorry about the wall, but I fell down a rabbit hole of interesting beer history." />

It doesn't actually makes a beer sour (it actually produces a very small amount of acid only), but &quot;wild&quot; beers usually have other types of what is called bugs (bacteria and other fungi) in it, which does leave a lot of acid to the final beer, making it sour.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;They also have regular beers (IPA, Saison, Pale Ale), and they're almost always creative and daring on their recipes.

It's very common with Imperial Stouts, for example, which is one of the styles that goes best with this kind of practice. Generally, boozy and dark beers are more suitable for this, but not only (people age belgian tripels, for example, which, while being sometimes boozy, aren't roasty at all).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, talking about oak, you get that vanilla, coconut, sherry flavors, sometimes some smoke from the barrel's inside toast, and things like that. Boozines is softened as well (mellowed). Off course, inside the barrel, a lot of complex reactions occurs, and I don't know how it can be compared with wine chemically, but, along with other compounds, tannins are incorporated to the beer, altough it doesn't always appear so much in the final product like in wines. It all depends on a series of factors, including the amount of time the liquid spends in the barrel.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Besides it, some aeration and in consequence oxidation does occur, but that's not the main purpose in that &quot;type&quot; of aging. Flavors of the original barrel's content may be picked as well, in higher or lower levels.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another main use of barrels in the beer industry is for production of wild/sour beers, in that case, the micro-aeration being a main desired factor. When people want to sour their beers and/or develop wild characteristics in it, they use different organisms after the primary fermentation. In order to sour it they use bacteria and for the rustic (wild) flavors they use another kind of yeast called brettanomyces in a further step of fermentation/maturation, in which oxygen presence is fundamental, but a slow pace is mandatory as well to avoid an overgrowth of the organisms and a possible &quot;spoilage&quot; of the beer. So, the barrel is a perfect place for this process to take place, because wood allows the oxygen to get in very slowly. Besides it, the barrel itself becomes a colony house for all those bugs (as brewers call those wild microorganisms), so you may not even need to pitch any yeast/bacteria after some time anymore. Off course, the wood alone impairs some flavors to the beer as well. You end up with a very, very complex product.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These days, people are doing all kinds of crazy experiments you can think of, and there's no mandatory rule when using barrels. It all depends on what result you want to achieve and real-world experience as well. There's a lot of methods, and every one is still figuring it out." />

I'm not a specialist, but I think before the american craft beer revolution and revival in the early 80's, no one was gathering and classifying beer styles in a guide like BJCP. And that same revival brought back to life many dead styles in different fashion (well, look the case of IPAs), by the way.&#xD;&#xA; - Generally, despite style guides, people have their own understanding of what is X or Y, and when naming their beers, they will do it based on their perception and references too, not strictly style guidelines.&#xD;&#xA; - If you look closer, porter and stout are ancient reference styles for more specific and contemporaneous styles (sweet stout, dry stout, outmeal stout, brown porter, robust porter, russian imperial stout, etc).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, I think it makes more sense telling the difference between a milk and an outmeal stout, or brown and baltic porter than stout X porter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For what's worth, for me, there's no difference between stout and porter. What I mean is, at least not so that we, as consumers, can trust and be 100% of what you are going to get if you choose one over the other, specially when the name is generic like that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What I think is enlightening is to understand the history of those related styles and how they came to be what they are today." />

A sour beer is what we'd consider to be a spoiled beer.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As a quick primer, &quot;wort&quot; is turned into &quot;beer&quot; when microbes convert the sugars in the liquid into alcohol, CO2, and ...other stuff.  Generally speaking, we use brewer's yeast (Saccharomyces Cerevisiae for ale or Sacc. Pastorianus for lager) because the other stuff tastes pretty nice, or at least doesn't taste bad.  Various strains of the same organism produce different byproducts, an example would be an English ale yeast which is well known for compounds that are kindof sweet or fruity vs Belgian ale yeasts which are well known for being peppery, clovy, or banana-y.  Those flavors all come from the yeast used for fermentation, but it's only ever a single strain of yeast, which was isolated in a lab.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sour beers are basically defined by not using a single isolated, clean-tasting strain of Saccharomyces.  The most common sour yeast used is in a genus called Brettanomyces, which depending on the specific species can produce flavors like...horse saddle, bandaid, cheese, cloves, and vinegar.  But most sour beers are not strictly brewed with yeasts like Sacc. or Brett. but also have bacteria in them.  Most commonly lactobacillus and pediococcus which are known for producing large amounts of lactic acid, which is where the sour really comes from.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's not to say sour beer brewers are being sloppy, because their &quot;infections&quot; aren't accidents.  They're deliberately trying to use less predictable and slow-acting organisms to create consistent beer.  That's tough.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As to a suggestion?  I like Tart of Darkness by The Bruery.  Petrus is good stuff and Duchesse de Bourgogne is nice.  Occasionally it's nice to find a really tart Berlinerweisse and mix it with a fruit syrup and Gose can be incredible paired with cheese." />

After the Industrial Revolution, with more hygiene and sterile tools, that characteristic became more and more uncommon, and at some point, undesirable. So, meanwhile, yeast was &quot;discovered&quot;, isolated, and fermentation controlled so that we had a clean taste profile, free from acids at all, which is what you know as beer nowadays.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Don't be fooled: **what really sours a beer are bacteria, not *Brettanomyces***. The later, also known as 'wild yeast', are usually found in sour beers as well, but are responsible for other aromas and flavors (barnyard and horse saddle being the most recognizable). (*Brett* actually produces a tiny amount of acid, no more than that).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some Belgians have been intentionally making sour beers for centuries, through spontaneous fermentation process (in the case of *lambics*) and barrel-aging after &quot;clean&quot; fermentation (in the case of *flanders reds*). Germans did it too, but their two traditional sour styles (*gose* and *berliner weisse*) are almost dead there, and differ from the belgians ones on the absence of *brett* character.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Nonetheless, nowadays people comprehend a lot better how those processes occur, and are doing sours again on purpose and manipulating those organisms in many ways. Basically, souring bacteria used are *pediococcus* and *lactobacillus* (not very different from *lambics*, actually). Most of the time, barrels are still used in the process, because of the micro-aeration those microorganisms need. And, off course, for keeping the microflora inside it, etc, etc, not to mention the flavor complexity that comes from wood compounds itself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A contaminated beer may end up being a sour. Well, so what distinguish a spoiled beer from a sour? Nothing actually, except that when people intentionally want to produce a sour, they do that with some more control in order to get the outcome they want and not some weird aleatory taste at the end. But, at some level, producing a sour beer, specially when using barrels, is always unpredictable too.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you can see, it's a rich and complex topic, probably the most exciting one about brewing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As suggestions, I definitely encourage you to taste the classic ones, belgian lambics (any *Gueuze* you find) and flanders reds (have you ever heard about *Rodenbach* and *Duchesse de Bourgogne*? they're amazing). I love *Petrus Aged Pale* too.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And, if you are from US, then you are bloody blessed, because american craft brewers are doing sour/wild beers like there were no tomorrow. =P Look for *Allagash*, *Russian River*, *Lost Abbey*, *The Bruery*, *Avery*, *Boulevard*, *Almanac*, *Deschutes*. The list is infinite. The thing is getting so serious that in the last years, all-sour breweries are popping up, like *Rare Barrel* from Berkeley." />

In commemoration of the brewery 150th year of activity, it produced Rodenbach Alexander (5,2% ABV). It was a variant of the Original one with a cherry taste. It is name comes from the brewery founder Alexander Rodenbach.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;After the take-over, Palm quickly stopped the production of Rodenbach's Alexander beer, a cherry-flavoured beer.[\[1\]][1] When Palm Brewery bought Rodenbach, another brewery it owned already made a cherry beer. At that time Alexander Rodenbach had to be ceased for contractual non-compete sorts of reasons. However, in recent years, Palm/Rodenbach has produced and distributed, first, Rodenbach foederbier, which is served only from cask, and is unfiltered and unblended. It comes straight from an oak riping barrel and is not processed further.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think the bartender told you to drink your Rodenbach with a shot of cherry, so that you can taste the original Rodenbach Alexander (the cherry-flavoured beer, Rodenbach's erstwhile cherry beer which produced before the brewery was sold to Palm). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.realbeer.com/news/articles/news-000720.php &quot;Palm Explains Plans for Rodenbach Beers&quot;" />

When you pour from the storage vessel to the glass you disturb the beer a lot which drives CO2 gas out, and that takes a lot of aromatics with it so the aroma you get from the beer in a glass is WAY stronger and more complex than what you'd sniff from the bottle or can.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also smell is a pretty huge part of tasting something and when you drink from a glass you're putting your nose right into the thick of all that, so the flavor will be more intense as well.  Bottles and cans sort of keep that toned down since you don't smell the beer as much.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There used to be a prejudice against cans because the liquid and the aluminum would react and oxidize, but they started coating the insides with a food safe epoxy resin decades ago and it's completely sealed now.  As far as taste goes there's no difference between the two, but cans actually store a bit better because they let in no light and no air while bottles will eventually let through enough to affect the beer.  Brewers like cans as well since they're more portable, don't shatter, chill faster, and are often cheaper to fill." />

After the Industrial Revolution, with more hygiene and sterile tools, that characteristic became more and more uncommon, and at some point, undesirable. So, meanwhile, yeast was &quot;discovered&quot;, isolated, and fermentation controlled so that we had a clean taste profile, free from acids at all, which is what you know as beer nowadays.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Don't be fooled: **what really sours a beer are bacteria, not *Brettanomyces***. The later, also known as 'wild yeast', are usually found in sour beers as well, but are responsible for other aromas and flavors (barnyard and horse saddle being the most recognizable). (*Brett* actually produces a tiny amount of acid, no more than that).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some Belgians have been intentionally making sour beers for centuries, through spontaneous fermentation process (in the case of *lambics*) and wood-aging (in large oak vats) after &quot;clean&quot; fermentation (in the case of *flanders reds*). Germans did it too, but their two traditional sour styles (*gose* and *berliner weisse*) are almost dead there, and differ from the belgians ones on the absence of *brett* character.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Nonetheless, nowadays people comprehend a lot better how those processes occur, and are doing sours again on purpose and manipulating those organisms in many ways. Basically, souring bacteria used are *pediococcus* and *lactobacillus* (not very different from *lambics*, actually). Most of the time, barrels are still used in the process, because of the micro-aeration those microorganisms need. And, off course, for keeping the microflora inside it, etc, etc, not to mention the flavor complexity that comes from wood compounds itself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A contaminated beer may end up being a sour. Well, so what distinguish a spoiled beer from a sour? Nothing actually, except that when people intentionally want to produce a sour, they do that with some more control in order to get the outcome they want and not some weird aleatory taste at the end. But, at some level, producing a sour beer, specially when using barrels, is always unpredictable too.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you can see, it's a rich and complex topic, probably the most exciting one about brewing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As suggestions, I definitely encourage you to taste the classic ones, belgian lambics (any *Gueuze* you find) and flanders reds (have you ever heard about *Rodenbach* and *Duchesse de Bourgogne*? they're amazing). I love *Petrus Aged Pale* too.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And, if you are from US, then you are bloody blessed, because american craft brewers are doing sour/wild beers like there were no tomorrow. =P Look for *Allagash*, *Russian River*, *Lost Abbey*, *The Bruery*, *Avery*, *Boulevard*, *Almanac*, *Deschutes*. The list is infinite. The thing is getting so serious that in the last years, all-sour breweries are popping up, like *Rare Barrel* from Berkeley." />

The older it is, the worse it will taste, but having drunk more than one in a sitting, I can safely say it's no more harmful than drinking a fresh one. Never gotten sick off one, but it's pretty hard to down them without gagging a bit.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some beers actually seem to intentionally go for a similar taste. Anything with a green bottle seems to be trying for a skunky flavor, while brown bottles help filter out damaging light. Compare a Beck's or Heineken to, say, a Budweiser.  The former will have a distinctly skunky flavor to them, basically similar to marijuana. The latter has a bit of a rice taste, as that's what's used in the brewing process, with a slight sweetness, but overall just a bubbly light flavor.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As Linus pointed out, there's going to be a &quot;wet cardboard&quot; taste with past-due light lagers. I'm guessing this is due to the breakdown of oils and sugars in the beer, as well as other general chemical changes. I'm not sure why it has that taste of cardboard or paper, but it's definitely present. After doing some research (aka looking it up on google), I found that the main culprit of that cardboard taste is a chemical called &quot;nonenal&quot;. It's apparently also a chemical in human body odor of aged people, leading to the so-called &quot;old people smell&quot;. This isn't proven, but there's some evidence that this is the main culprit for the somewhat-neutral scent of older people's perspiration. In a beer, not quite as neutral, however." />

Beck's uses roasted hops and has a more bitter earthy flavor with much less foam.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The flavor of other &quot;light lagers&quot; (european pilsners) may be similar, however, a German pilsner is much easier to drink because, unlike most other light lager beers, a true pilsner is much less filling and has much less foam. German pilsners are noted for &quot;drinkability&quot;. Beck's can be consumed with a large meal and then consumed afterwards as well. I believe this is why many non beer drinkers prefer and enjoy Beck's and almost no other beer. [Click here for a list of &quot;German style pilsners&quot; as well as a list of the other types of similar beers and what makes them different][1] Light lagers such as Heinekin, Stella, Amstel, etc ... are &quot;European pilsner&quot; beers typically labeled as lager whereas a German pilsner beer is typically labeled &quot;pilsner&quot; or &quot;pils&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Heineken does produce a true pilsner variety][2] but it is not officially distributed or available within the United States.

Tsingtao is a product of the German occupation of Qingdao from the late 1800s until 1914. Not quite a flavorful as Beck's because the original recipe has changed but still a German pilsner in many aspects. Tsingtao is widely available at many Asian restaurants throughout North America and is a much better alternative or substitute for Beck's than Heinekin or Stella.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Löwenbräu produces Beck's under licence for southern Germany and other parts of europe and is known for similar flavor (but then again, so is Heineken).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, [here is another list of German Pilsners.][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;Update:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you're going to go the way of sam adams, at least get the right kind of beer and not some awful american lager.

Sure enough, I didn't have to burp once. Drank a full pint glass and wasn't bloated one bit. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, the taste was the same familiar strong, pungent, and bitter hoppy taste I've grown so fond of from drinking German Beck's over the years and yes it comes in a very dark brown bottle. The bitterness is ranked at 21. They also make a pils with a bitterness of 32.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I feel it should be added that beer brewed in Germany often conforms to the Reinheitsgebot or the German purity law of 1516. This gives German beer the crisp fresh taste and this is also why the foam doesn't linger and make you feel bloated.

However, if we want to play analysis, the answer would certainly be whiskey, American bourbon most likely. Let's go through the choices. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1) Wine. No way. If someone is going to generically order wine, they at least specify a color, red or white. Plus wine is mostly all the same strength, only varying a couple percent either direction, unless you count fortified wines, which are another topic. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2) Beer. Ordering a generic beer would get you a basic beer, which isn't very strong. Only a few specialized beer bars would have any beers that I'd call really strong. Any beer stronger than 12% is going to be very rare, with most bars not even having above 8%. The kinds of people who order strong beers, these 8, 9, 10, etc beers, would always order by name. They are craft beer fans. These aren't really strong enough to help someone in distress. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3) Vodka. Unless you are a Russian or a huge vodka fan, you don't order vodka straight like this. Vodka is generally for mixing in America. The people who are serious about vodka drinking would order by brand name.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4) Gin is the same story as vodka really. Gin in generally served in mixed form, although a dry gin martini is close to 100% gin, it still counts as mixed. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;5) Cordials, liquers, etc. Again, would be ordered by type or brand, and often not that strong compared to the main liquors. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;6) Rum, can be quite strong, makes decent shots, makes decent sipping. But it conjours up images of pirate and or topical locations. If the movie is set in the Caribbean, they would mean rum. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;7) Tequila. It's strong, makes good shots. Not so great for sipping, unless you are talking about the really good stuff or you are a tequila fan. If you are in Mexico or a Cantina, they would mean tequila. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;8) Whiskey. This is the winning category. It's always strong. It tastes good in shots, and makes fine sipping from a glass. This is manly and good for all classes of life. Blue collars and white collars alike love whiskey. if you are doing, &quot;forget your troubles&quot; kinda drinking, whiskey is the best choice. If you are sad, or upset, or worried, or looking for a fight, or anything like that, whiskey is the best choice. A real American manly man is going to want whiskey, usually bourbon, something like Knob's Creek. Some will prefer Irish whiskeys, or Scottish Whiskys, (notice no e), but if they do, they will say so by name. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I mean, I know if I was upset like that and going to a bar and said a stupid order like gimme a strong one, I would mean bourbon. If I wanted a beer, to get back on topic, I'd be like, &quot;What kind of IPAs you got?&quot; &quot;Any sours?&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;:)" />

Text="As of today (2015), there are several microbreweries operating in Iceland. The micro- and homebrewing scene has been budding nicely in the last few years, the latest player being Steðji (founded in 2012).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## The Breweries ##&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In a category of their own are [Borg][1] and [Einstök][2]. These two operate under the wing of the two &quot;large&quot; local breweries (Egils and Víking), serving as their respective experimental departments. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * Borg keeps up a steady stream of new beers each year, easily Iceland's most &quot;prolific publisher&quot;. They have a steady production of the big-name styles (a lager, an IPA, a porter, etc.), and nearly always one or two beers on limited/temporary release.&#xD;&#xA; * Einstök produces the country's most widely sold ales, and seasonal varieties.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other microbreweries are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [Bruggsmiðjan][3]. Founded in 2006, they are the oldest microbrewery in Iceland (yup). They produce a line of Czech-style lagers, brand name Kaldi.&#xD;&#xA; - [Gæðingur][4]. Their gig is essentially similar to Borg's - steady production of big name styles, interspersed with experiments.&#xD;&#xA; - [Steðji][5]. Their lineup is a mix of very normal German-style lagers and some truly wacky stuff - for instance, their [infamous *whale beer*, Hvalur][6].&#xD;&#xA; - [Ölvisholt Brugghús][7]. ÖB is of the more established players, but their beers do not follow a particular trend that I have noticed. If anything, I could say they rely on beers &quot;with a twist&quot; more than the others, not many of their beers fall neatly into a common style.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At the time of writing, this list is exhaustive for operational breweries.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Microbrews and Craft Beers on Tap ##&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Several bars pride themselves on selling Icelandic micro- and craft brews. These are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * Microbar. There are two bars operating under this name, one in downtown Reykjavík, the other in Sauðárkrókur. The one in Reykjavík is the pioneer of the Icelandic craft bar scene. It is owned by the Gæðingur brewery, and appropriately, you can always find Gæðingur beers on tap here (among others). Aside from their taps, they can also boast of the largest selection of bottled beer in the country.&#xD;&#xA; * Skúli Craft Bar, in downtown Reykjavík. It is notable for its diverse and rapidly rotating taps. At any given time, about half of them are likely to  be connected to local beers. The bar is independent, but beers from Borg brewery are always prominent in their choices. &#xD;&#xA; * Bjórgarðurinn, in Reykjavík. They have 24 taps, Icelandic craft beers always among them. Unlike the other establishments on this list, they serve food other than bar snacks, mostly gourmet sausages that they recommend pairing with particular beers. It is a hotel bar, not associated with a brewery.&#xD;&#xA; * Kaldi Bar, in downtown Reykjavík. It is not owned by Bruggsmiðjan, but it brands itself as a place where you can get local beer, in particular, Bruggsmiðjan's Kaldi. This is, however, not a place I would call a *craft bar* that prides itself on a varied selection.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Micro/Craft beer fans will also want to know of Mikkeller &amp; Friends Reykjavík. Large tap selection there, but no focus on local produce.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Borg and Einstök taps can commonly be found interspersed with the common Egils and Víking taps. Steðji and Ölvisholt beers are only sporadically found on taps.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many other bars (but *definitely* not all) have some ambition when it comes to bottled craft beer availability without making a particular deal of it. Ask your bartender!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Selected products ##&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Off the top of my head, here are a few items I consider distinctive - or at least, I have not found anything *quite* like them abroad.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Garún. Imperial stout, more heavy on the licorice than most.&#xD;&#xA; - Lava. A smoked imperial stout.&#xD;&#xA; - Snorri. An ale spiced with Icelandic thyme.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And always, keep an eye out for seasonal beers. The breweries usually allow themselves more creative freedom on those products. Last year (2014), we saw beers like the Einstök Arctic Berry Ale (beer flavored with Icelandic berries), Fenrir (an IPA smoked with sheep dung) and Hvalur (the whale beer mentioned earlier).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## General beer buying advisory ##&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You **won't** buy Icelandic beers in the supermarket. The things that look like beers in those shelves are low-alcohol versions. To buy beers, you must go to one of the state-operated [&quot;Wine stores&quot;][12] (Vínbúð). Beware of their opening hours - they are never open after 20:00, on Sundays, or on holidays.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Source: Icelandic beer enthusiast.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.borgbrugghus.is/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://einstokbeer.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.bruggsmidjan.is/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.gaedingur-ol.is/&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://www.stedji.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://www.stedji.com/hvalur-1-2.html&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://www.brugghus.is/&#xD;&#xA;  [12]: http://www.vinbudin.is/" />

If anything, I could say they rely on beers &quot;with a twist&quot; more than the others, not many of their beers fall neatly into a common style.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At the time of writing, this list is exhaustive for operational breweries.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Microbrews and Craft Beers on Tap ##&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Several bars pride themselves on selling Icelandic micro- and craft brews. These are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * Microbar. There are two bars operating under this name, one in downtown Reykjavík, the other in Sauðárkrókur. The one in Reykjavík is the pioneer of the Icelandic craft bar scene. It is owned by the Gæðingur brewery, and appropriately, you can always find Gæðingur beers on tap here (among others). Aside from their taps, they can also boast of the largest selection of bottled beer in the country.&#xD;&#xA; * Skúli Craft Bar, in downtown Reykjavík. It is notable for its diverse and rapidly rotating taps. At any given time, about half of them are likely to  be connected to local beers. The bar is independent, but beers from Borg brewery are always prominent in their choices. &#xD;&#xA; * Bjórgarðurinn, in Reykjavík. They have 22 taps, Icelandic craft beers always among them. Unlike the other establishments on this list, they serve food other than bar snacks, mostly gourmet sausages that they recommend pairing with particular beers. It is a hotel bar, not associated with a brewery.&#xD;&#xA; * Kaldi Bar, in downtown Reykjavík. It is not owned by Bruggsmiðjan, but it brands itself as a place where you can get local beer, in particular, Bruggsmiðjan's Kaldi. This is, however, not a place I would call a *craft bar* that prides itself on a varied selection.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Micro/Craft beer fans will also want to know of Mikkeller &amp; Friends Reykjavík. Large tap selection there, but no focus on local produce.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Borg and Einstök taps can commonly be found interspersed with the common Egils and Víking taps. Steðji and Ölvisholt beers are only sporadically found on taps.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many other bars (but *definitely* not all) have some ambition when it comes to bottled craft beer availability without making a particular deal of it. Ask your bartender!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Selected products ##&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Off the top of my head, here are a few items I consider distinctive - or at least, I have not found anything *quite* like them abroad.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Garún. Imperial stout, more heavy on the licorice than most.&#xD;&#xA; - Lava. A smoked imperial stout.&#xD;&#xA; - Snorri. An ale spiced with Icelandic thyme.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And always, keep an eye out for seasonal beers. The breweries usually allow themselves more creative freedom on those products. Last year (2014), we saw beers like the Einstök Arctic Berry Ale (beer flavored with Icelandic berries), Fenrir (an IPA smoked with sheep dung) and Hvalur (the whale beer mentioned earlier).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## General beer buying advisory ##&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You **won't** buy Icelandic beers in the supermarket. The things that look like beers in those shelves are low-alcohol versions. To buy beers, you must go to one of the state-operated [&quot;Wine stores&quot;][12] (Vínbúð). Beware of their opening hours - they are never open after 20:00, on Sundays, or on holidays.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Source: Icelandic beer enthusiast.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.borgbrugghus.is/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://einstokbeer.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.bruggsmidjan.is/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.gaedingur-ol.is/&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://www.stedji.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://www.stedji.com/hvalur-1-2.html&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://www.brugghus.is/&#xD;&#xA;  [12]: http://www.vinbudin.is/" />

Since then, 'craft' or 'microbrew' grew slowly through the years.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A lengthy but interesting report called [THE MARKET FOR CRAFT AND SPECIALTY BEER, A Market Intelligence Report, March 1997][1] has an impressive description of why craft in particular was able to keep growing, and why it wasn't labeled a 'fad':&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;There is also a floor under the craft/specialty segment. This is not&#xD;&#xA;&gt; a fad segment like packaged draft, dry, ice, clear, or perhaps even&#xD;&#xA;&gt; red. While growth in the craft segment will slow, it will not peak&#xD;&#xA;&gt; quickly and then lose share, as the fad beers have. The&#xD;&#xA;&gt; craft/specialty segment has firm underpinnings from homebrewers and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; other beer aficionados. Many of the homebrewers prefer to brew their&#xD;&#xA;&gt; own beer (done right, it’s even better than the best of the craft&#xD;&#xA;&gt; brews), but they often sample commercial brews to try unfamiliar or&#xD;&#xA;&gt; difficult-to-brew styles, and of course they’re top prospects for&#xD;&#xA;&gt; drinking craft brews when they are at a restaurant or brewpub.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That explains a lot through the 90's, but why the quicker increase in growth patterns in the last 10 years?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;According to the [Brewers Association][2] (a US-based trade group): &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;Between 2011 and 2013, 80% of craft growth came from new craft&#xD;&#xA;&gt; appreciators, the majority of which were in the 21 to 29 age group,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; and their impact is still muted. Lester Jones of the National Beer&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Wholesalers Association (NBWA) sees Millennials as not fully&#xD;&#xA;&gt; economically activated yet due to the impact of the economic recession&#xD;&#xA;&gt; and their struggle to transition into aging Baby Boomer jobs. This&#xD;&#xA;&gt; means as the economy improves we should feel the impact of the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Millennials even more. The message here is the fastest growing and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; most influential demographic is also moving the fastest toward craft.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Pair this with the increased ideals behind &quot;Trade-ups and premiumization&quot;, and you have people willing to spend a little more to gain an perceived increase in value and quality.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[IBISWorld][3] shares that craft beer has enjoyed a 19% growth in the past 5 years. I don't know about you, but that's incredible considering the economic woes of developed nations. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It appears to boil down to a long, slow pattern of growth that has reached a massive generational shift in consumption which has caused a spike in sales volume, which in turn is pushing every store from New Jersey to Frankfurt to attempt to capitalize on one of the few growth industries.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.angelfire.com/al4/tato/subsite/images/Market%20for%20Craft%20and%20Specialty%20Beer%2097.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://www.brewersassociation.org/news/ba-insider-growth-craft-beer-segment-sky-limit/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.ibisworld.com/industry/craft-beer-production.html" />

I also know that, in between those two extremes, the relationship is *not* linear (*e.g.*, 3.2% ABW is approximately 4.0% ABV). However, any web-site calculator that I see pretty much performs the calculation as linear.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've been fiddling with my TI-89 from high school, and I think that I have it figured out.

At that same temperature, water has a density of approximately .99823 kg/l and not 1 kg/l. Using this, I arrived at a different formula that's probably more accurate (at 20°C, that is):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    ABV = (99823 · ABW) ÷ (20923 · ABW + 78945)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;EDIT: Please see AlkonMikko's comment." />

Producers&#xD;&#xA;2. Distributors&#xD;&#xA;3. Retailers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A few states allow the producer to engage in self-distribution (usually to a limited degree) but most require that a brewery get distribution rights with a third party, which will hold full, exclusive, and unlimited rights to shipping that producer's beer. [ProBrewer.com][1] has some excellent reading on the subject.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The rules and regulations pertaining to the distribution and advertising of beer products are highly regulated and are enacted and enforced at the state level. Therefore, each state has its own set of laws in which the brewer is responsible for knowing and abiding by. It is incumbent on you, the brewer, to know the specific regulations of each state in which you sell.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It boils down to what the distributor wants to do and state-by-state requirements for what can be sold there. [Ohio has a cap on alcohol by volume of 12%.][2] [Any beer over 4% ABV in Oklahoma must be sold only at liquor stores at room temperature][3]. It varies so much that some brewers don't want to go into those markets.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Demand&#xD;&#xA;======&#xD;&#xA;There's also the simple issue of supply and demand. In 2013, Founders Brewing [delayed entering the Florida market for a few months][4] while they brought on more 600BBL fermenters because of some slight under-reporting of potential market numbers. There's nothing worse than not being able to supply your customers with beer. (Ahem, Cigar City's [Great Jai-Alai Shortage of 2013][5]).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Expense&#xD;&#xA;======&#xD;&#xA;Bottling/canning beer is expensive. There's also only a certain amount of time available to package. This is why there will usually be only a certain number and type of beer that gets packaged in these containers until a brewery grows to a certain size that allows better economies of scale. Once there, it's easier to start releasing seasonals, one-offs, and more nuanced beer styles compared to just cranking out a wheat ale or amber ale.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.probrewer.com/library/distribution/distribution-101/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://brewprof.com/ohio-abv-increase-bill-gaining-traction/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=78096&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/restaurants/founders-brewing-delays-florida-distribution-citing-upgrade-delays-6906560&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/restaurants/beer-shortage-cigar-city-acknowledges-jai-alai-supply-problem-6892674" />

The occasional offering that we sell, uses oysters at the end of the mash regime (hot soaking of the grains). The idea here is that you are extracting calcium carbonate from the shells, which helps reduce the tannic astringency that can result from the roasted grains used in stouts. This is the same reason/benefit that stouts are traditionally brewed in areas with relatively hard water. It also happens to be the perfect temperature for cooking oysters. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Oysters cooked or uncooked could be added at other parts of the process, but may not have the same impact on reducing astringency.

The occasional offering that we sell (Niagara College Teaching Brewery), uses oysters at the end of the mash regime (hot soaking of the grains). The idea here is that you are extracting calcium carbonate from the shells, which helps reduce the tannic astringency that can result from the roasted grains used in stouts. This is the same reason/benefit that stouts are traditionally brewed in areas with relatively hard water. It also happens to be the perfect temperature for cooking oysters. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Oysters cooked or uncooked could be added at other parts of the process, but may not have the same impact on reducing astringency. There is a subtle undertone of the oyster that makes it into the finished product, but your palate may vary and may or may not detect it (depending on process and quantity used). " />

When you open the tap beer comes out.  Generally you want to drink the beer quickly in this situation as it will go off.  This method is commonly seen in beer exhibitions.&#xA;&#xA;The other method is to use an overpressure of gas to push beer out.  The gas can be CO2, Nitrogen or air.  The pressure is usually generated by some form of pump.  For Real Ale the handpump is the device of choice forcing air onto the beer and powered by human.  In some places in Scotland the handpump is replaced by a water powered pump because Scots are engineers.&#xA;&#xA;When the real ale resurrection happened in the 70s barmaids were actually warned to swap hands used to pull the pump lest they increase the muscles on one side and became lopsided as it were." />

That said, for getting beer out of the cask/keg/barrel you generally have 3 options:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1.  Pressurized gas.  As mentioned by the other answer this is most commonly CO2 since CO2 is produced by yeast, so if you sealed the container while yeast were still processing sugars and producing CO2, they would pressurize the container.  Some brewers, especially home brewers, will pressurize their kegs through natural carbonation but most just push CO2 from a canister.  BUT there's also &quot;beer gas&quot; which is a mix of Nitrogen and CO2, think Guinness or Boddingtons.  This came into use to emulate the soft carbonation of cask/real ale/kellerbier, which leads to:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. Siphoning.  A hand pump, or beer engine, uses a siphon to &quot;pull&quot; the beer out of the cask and up to the tap.  The physics needs atmospheric pressure to be maintained inside the cask, so it's usually open to the air at the top.  This required a fast turnaround on casks to prevent the beer from spoiling, which is one of the reasons cask/&quot;real&quot; ale fell out favor.  Kegs simply kept longer and were more economical.  I think CAMRA still isn't a fan of them, but some bars use &quot;breathers&quot; which basically add very low pressures of CO2 to replace the volume lost by the beer, but not enough to pressurize the cask.  This just lets the beer last longer in the cask.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. Gravity pouring.  This tends to happen most often at festivals or if a bar has a &quot;guest cask&quot;.  A spout is installed in the side and beer pours out.  All the caveats about air spoilage from cask ale still exist here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So if the bartender pulls a handle and leaves it there until the glass is full of beer, that's a pressurized gas system.  If the bartender has to keep pulling the handle to fill the glass and the beer has that cool &quot;cascading&quot; look, it was pulled by siphoning.  If the cask is on the bar and the bartender just opens a spigot...that's a gravity pour.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't know that there are any other options...maybe an open barrel and ladling the beer out like soup?" />

Ultimately sweet beers are part of the style they are in so avoiding sugary sweet beers is as simple as knowing the styles.  You can skip to the bottom if that's all you want to know.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are two types of sweetness that are often discussed and sometimes confused in beer, a Malty flavor and a Sweet flavor. The same ingredients are involved but in different ways.  Sugary sweet beers basically come from unfermented sugars which simply means sugars that the yeast hasn't processed to create alcohol and carbon dioxide.  This is also called attenuation.  Wikipedia has a good link for this but I can only post two links at the moment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This can be caused by a few different things such as unfermentable sugars that come from the way the beer is mashed (when the grains are mixed in with hot water and left to sit for a specific length of time) or from specialty grains, or the yeast itself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The explanation of how the mash affects sweetness is very complex and full of biochemistry.  I will try to summarize.  Grains are full of starches that need to be converted to sugar for the yeast to ferment.  There are two main enzymes involved in this process, alpha and beta amylase enzymes.  Using a branched tree analogy works great.  After a strong storm you need to clean up your yard from the limbs that have fallen from the trees.  You have a lopper (alpha amylase) which is great for cutting the branches apart from the limbs but still leave you with long branches and twigs.  You also have a chipper (beta amylase) which is good at taking the branches and twigs and cutting them into little pieces that are easy to use.  The two enzymes need to do their work together to make the most fermentable sugars out of the starches stored in the grains.  Alpha amylase is good at breaking the limbs apart into long starch chains but these are not easy for yeast to ferment.  Beta amylase is great at making small glucose chains that the yeast can convert but the big limbs are too big to get into the chipper, if the alpha amylase doesn't do its job first the beta amylase cant do its job well.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The kicker is each enzyme works in a specific temperature range (beta amylase 131-150°F and alpha amylase 154-162°F).  A brewer can manipulate the mash temperature to ensure both enzymes are working with an overlapping temperature (for instance 152°F) or adjust the temperature up or down to accentuate one enzyme over the other.  For instance if we mashed at 158°F the beta amylase will denature and not affect the beer, while the alpha amylase will be very happy and busy.  This will result in more long starch molecules in the beer which are harder for yeast to ferment and result in a sweeter beer!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unfermentable sugars can also come from specialty grains added to the beer for flavor and intentional sweetness.  The usual suspects are roasted grains where the sugars inside the grain will start to caramelize such as Dark caramel and roasted malts like Crystal 80, Crystal 120, Special B, Chocolate Malt, and Roast Barley.  Below is a great place for people to start learning the intricacies of brewing beer at home.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://www.howtobrew.com/section4/chapter20-1.html&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ultimately these things are done by brewers to make their beer fit into the style they are trying to make along with other things like the amount and type of hops used and other adjuncts (stuff added to beer like fruit or rice or...)  So to avoid sugary beers you mainly need to know what styles are not sweet or its as simple as saying know what types of beers you like.  If you really want to learn the styles turn to the Beer Style Guide!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/catdex.php&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Look around and see which are sweet and avoid, meanwhile look for highly attenuated beers.  Id expect some you would like are:&#xD;&#xA;German Pilsners&#xD;&#xA;American Lagers and Pilsners&#xD;&#xA;Berliner-Style Weisse&#xD;&#xA;Dunkel Weizen/Dunkel Weissbier&#xD;&#xA;Munich Helles&#xD;&#xA;Belgian-Style Pale Strong Ale&#xD;&#xA;Pale Ales shouldn't be too sweet&#xD;&#xA;Kölsch&#xD;&#xA;IPAs should be dry&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;if you want to be adventurous try a Wood- and Barrel-Aged Sour Beer.  They are supposed to be dry although I cant speak from experience.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I hope this helps.&#xD;&#xA;BMB&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  " />

Before the discovery/invention of force carbonation methods, all beer was carbonated naturally via bottle or cask conditioning. But people were brewing alcoholic beverages commonly referred to as beer in antiquity, and [evidence][1] from these cultures ([ancient China][2], Neolithic culture, etc) suggests that they were doing this in big stone and earthenware pots and jugs, which may have had no lids or loose lids. Their vessels probably could not have withstood the pressure of carbonation even if they were using wax or cork to seal the vessels.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So if you were to brew a historical style and you wanted to be truly accurate, then you would not carbonate it. But the modern historical interpretations usually are carbonated (like [Dogfish Head's ancient ales][3]), because they are selling them and Westerners generally prefer them :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is one &quot;modern style&quot; (e.g. [a style you'd find in the BJCP style guide][4]), that can be served with [no carbonation][5], namely [straight (unblended) lambic][6]. Several have little or low carbonation, (e.g. barleywine) mentioned in other answers. [Sahti][7] also has very little carbonation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But people do still drink flat/still beer all over the world, for example there's some uncarbonated corn beers that are popular, like [chicha][8] in Latin America ([Dogfish Head made a Chicha inspired beer][9]) and [umqombothi][10] in South Africa. There are other names for similar beers in other regions. These are typically homebrewed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Edward_McGovern#Investigations_of_ancient_dyes.2C_foods.2C_beverages.2C_and_other_organics&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiahu&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.dogfish.com/ancientales&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/catdex.php&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://books.google.com/books?id=gYVLHMmplRcC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;lpg=PA221&amp;dq=oxford%20beer%20companion%20carbonation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MGgbsp_cV7&amp;sig=34ClGqwJYwLtNhACLrhsw7Ot8Zc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=itX_Ut-2PKPWyQG5m4DQDw&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=oxford%20beer%20companion%20carbonation&amp;f=false&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style17.php#1d&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahti&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicha&#xD;&#xA;  [9]: http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/09/dining/09beer.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;sq=dogfish&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=1&#xD;&#xA;  [10]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umqombothi" />

The large volume of ingredients means that the beer will (usually) have complex malt flavours.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Mashing:**&#xD;&#xA;We immediately run into a problem: You can only get so much sugar out of malt. So you use all sorts of tricks to get the most out of your malt.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Boiling:**&#xD;&#xA;To increase the sugar content the brewers add sugars to the wort. Next problem: too much sugar and the beer does not taste very good and fermentation problems are a possible problem. (Sugars can also be added to the fermentation). Another trick is to concentrate the wort by boiling for a longer period. The water evaporates, but the sugars and other ingredients stay in the wort. Note that a large amount of hops is required to balance all the sugars.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Fermentation:** High gravity beers are notoriously difficult to ferment. The biggest problem is that the alcohol in the beer becomes so much that it poisons the yeast. So, you need a yeast that is &quot;strong&quot; enough to work in these harsh conditions. You will often find that brewers will mix strains, starting with a lager, then going to ale, then to champagne or wine yeast. Most &quot;normal&quot; yeasts will (with help) get you a product of 15-20% ABV. Stronger yeasts can go higher than 20%, but not much further.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Post Fermentation:**&#xD;&#xA;Lest assume that you ended with a naturally fermented product of 20%. Fermentation is complete and your yeast is dead. The alcohol kills any other yeast that you add. What next? Ice concentration! This process is seen as a form of distilling. You put your fermenter in a freezer and scoop out the ice crystals. As water freezes before alcohol, the alcohol in the beer increases. Stronger beer! But the penalty is that you use a lot of flavour and aroma during this process.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**The final product:** A boozy, typically malty, bready, product, usually on the sweeter side. The body tends to be heavy. Hops is usually low to none, unless the beer was dry-hopped post concentration.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here is a list of the strongest beers:&#xD;&#xA;http://www.beertutor.com/beers/index.php?t=highest_alcohol" />

The micro- and homebrewing scene has been budding nicely in the last few years, the latest player being Steðji (founded in 2012).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## The Breweries ##&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In a category of their own are [Borg][1] and [Einstök][2]. These two operate under the wing of the two &quot;large&quot; local breweries (Egils and Víking), serving as their respective experimental departments. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * Borg keeps up a steady stream of new beers each year, easily Iceland's most &quot;prolific publisher&quot;. They have a steady production of the big-name styles (a lager, an IPA, a porter, etc.), and nearly always one or two beers on limited/temporary release.&#xD;&#xA; * Einstök produces the country's most widely sold ales, and seasonal varieties.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other microbreweries are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [Bruggsmiðjan][3]. Founded in 2006, they are the oldest microbrewery in Iceland (yup). They produce a line of Czech-style lagers, brand name Kaldi.&#xD;&#xA; - [Gæðingur][4]. Their gig is essentially similar to Borg's - steady production of big name styles, interspersed with experiments.&#xD;&#xA; - [Steðji][5]. Their lineup is a mix of very normal German-style lagers and some truly wacky stuff - for instance, their [infamous *whale beer*, Hvalur][6].&#xD;&#xA; - [Ölvisholt Brugghús][7]. ÖB is of the more established players, but their beers do not follow a particular trend that I have noticed. If anything, I could say they rely on beers &quot;with a twist&quot; more than the others, not many of their beers fall neatly into a common style.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At the time of writing, this list is exhaustive for operational breweries.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Microbrews and Craft Beers on Tap ##&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Several bars pride themselves on selling Icelandic micro- and craft brews. These are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * Microbar. There are two bars operating under this name, one in downtown Reykjavík, the other in Sauðárkrókur. The one in Reykjavík is the pioneer of the Icelandic craft bar scene. It is owned by the Gæðingur brewery, and appropriately, you can always find Gæðingur beers on tap here (among other local beers)&#xD;&#xA; * Skúli Craft Bar, in downtown Reykjavík. It is notable for its diverse and rapidly rotating taps. At any given time, about half of them are likely to  be connected to local beers. The bar is independent, but beers from Borg brewery are always prominent in their choices. &#xD;&#xA; * Bjórgarðurinn, in Reykjavík. They have 22 taps, Icelandic craft beers always among them. They serve food other than bar snacks, mostly gourmet sausages that they recommend pairing with particular beers. It is a hotel bar, not associated with a brewery.&#xD;&#xA; * Bryggjan Brugghús, in Reykjavík near the harbor area. The only brewpub in Reykjavík, and the only establishment on this list that also has an actual restaurant. At the time of writing, it is very recently opened.&#xD;&#xA; * Kaldi Bar, in downtown Reykjavík. It is not owned by Bruggsmiðjan, but it brands itself as a place where you can get local beer, in particular, Bruggsmiðjan's Kaldi. This is, however, not a place I would call a *craft bar* that prides itself on a varied selection.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Micro/Craft beer fans will also want to know of Mikkeller &amp; Friends Reykjavík. Large tap selection there, but no focus on local produce.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Borg and Einstök taps can commonly be found interspersed with the common Egils and Víking taps. Steðji and Ölvisholt beers are only sporadically found on taps.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many other bars (but *definitely* not all) have some ambition when it comes to bottled craft beer availability without making a particular deal of it. Ask your bartender!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Selected products ##&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Off the top of my head, here are a few items I consider distinctive - or at least, I have not found anything *quite* like them abroad.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Garún. Imperial stout, more heavy on the licorice than most.&#xD;&#xA; - Lava. A smoked imperial stout.&#xD;&#xA; - Snorri. An ale spiced with Icelandic thyme.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And always, keep an eye out for seasonal beers. The breweries usually allow themselves more creative freedom on those products. Last year (2014), we saw beers like the Einstök Arctic Berry Ale (beer flavored with Icelandic berries), Fenrir (an IPA smoked with sheep dung) and Hvalur (the whale beer mentioned earlier).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## General beer buying advisory ##&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You **won't** buy Icelandic beers in the supermarket. The things that look like beers in those shelves are low-alcohol versions. To buy beers, you must go to one of the state-operated [&quot;Wine stores&quot;][12] (Vínbúð). Beware of their opening hours - they are never open after 20:00, on Sundays, or on holidays.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Source: Icelandic beer enthusiast.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.borgbrugghus.is/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://einstokbeer.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.bruggsmidjan.is/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.gaedingur-ol.is/&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://www.stedji.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://www.stedji.com/hvalur-1-2.html&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://www.brugghus.is/&#xD;&#xA;  [12]: http://www.vinbudin.is/" />

You need the other beer to have a different density from Guinness, at least if you want it to stay separated for any length of time. And be careful which Guinness you use because there are a number of them out there with different &quot;strengths&quot;.  If the densities are too close, they'll mix together.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A good starting point in selecting interesting combinations is to look at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brewersfriend.com/2009/02/04/beer-styles-original-gravity-and-final-gravity-chart/&quot;&gt;densities across different styles&lt;/a&gt;.  Pick two that are widely different and find bottles of each.  For instance, if you take a bottle of a kriek (red-looking fruit lambic), it would probably float nicely on most other beers, but you'd want to pick a nice, dark beer to show off the contrast (plus, if you used a kriek (cherry) or frambois (raspberry), pairing it with a porter or stout that has nice chocolate tones would taste very nice).  Likewise, just about anything would float on a bock or a strong scotch ale like a &quot;wee heavy&quot;." />

I disliked beer when I was young.  It was not until I tasted ale imported from England that I liked it and sought it out.  I loved Samuel Smith's, Old Peculiar, Bass Ale, and others.  I expanded from there and sought out other beers and ales that were not your ordinary North American Lagers and found many I liked.  I quickly discovered homebrewing while perusing a used bookstore.  This was way before it was popular here and way before 'Craft Brewing' was a term that people knew.  I started to make my own.  Now I really like beer. However I still don't really like most of the big-brand beers.  And I don't drink beer as a thirst quencher.  But if someone offers me a beer - I am no snob and say yes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As far as DNA or genetically based dislikes.  I don't think there is a 'beer' gene.  There may, however be genes that make people dislike, or at least avoid certain tastes or aromas, or perceive these in different ways. These could then translate to dislikes of beer.  However, there are so many types of beers that this is probably very unlikely.  It would at least it's unlikely that beer would be the only thing that would be affected by this inheritance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think a dislike of beer can be overcome.  Many people have notions of beer that are not really true.  A friend said she hated dark beer because it was too bitter.  I explained that this was not really true (that all dark beer is very bitter). So, I brought over some examples that were not bitter, but chocolaty, sweet, roasty, etc.  She now loves dark beers (most are actually not very bitter).  With some people it is really difficult to overcome these dislikes however.  But at least, in my opinion, most of these dislikes are learned." />

If the second was better than the first, take a third.  If the third was better than the second then keep going.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Never be afraid to try new brews.&#xD;&#xA;" />

Until this time beer was flavored with a mix of herbs and spices called &quot;gruit&quot; which was taxed (generally by either the government or the Roman Catholic Church) and in many cases required by law, so when hops did appear, they appears in regions where the church had less control.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hops didn't make their way to England until around 1500 A.D., and weren't universally used until around the year 1600.   Since Henry VIII reigned from 1509 until 1547, it would have been early in the introduction of hops to the region, and it is certainly within the realm of possibility that he may have outlawed them as a threat to the tax revenue stream provided by the sale of gruit.   Eventually though, demand for hops won out, and Henry's own wars with the Catholic Church may have weakened the ability to gruit rights-holders to continue to monopolize the market, and as I mentioned, by fifty years after Henry's death, hops ultimately won the war.   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Sometimes beer in the bottle is pasteurized, while the keg is not. Sometimes one or the other is filtered, while the other is not. The gas content can also differ, since this is adjustable in draught systems but not with bottles.&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;In some cases, such as when yeast content is very important for the flavor profile of a beer, like German Hefeweizen, how much yeast you get in your glass has a big impact on the drinking experience. When drinking from the bottle, you can make sure that you get all of the yeast from the bottom of the bottle into your glass by agitating the last few ounces of beer, but this isn't possible with a keg. &#xD;&#xA;Kegged versions of these beers still have yeast in them, but you're not getting that perfect ratio in every glass. In my two years as a beer enthusiast living in Germany, these beers are almost always served from the bottle, and every bar or bartender has their preferred method for getting all the yeast out of a bottle.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Question two**: What is done to bottled beer to prolong its shelf life?&#xD;&#xA;This also differs from beer to beer. Some imports are pasteurized in the bottle, some others, namely MillerCoors products, use proprietary hop derivatives like Tetrahop to keep hop flavor while minimizing hop oils' susceptibility to producing off-flavors due to light exposure. This isn't a bad or unnatural thing, and I hope this becomes more widespread, because skunked, lightstruck beer is awful. (see [this interview][1]) This, however, is also present in kegged beer, as it has other beneficial properties like increased head retention.&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes, though, nothing is done beyond packaging, like Sierra Nevada's transition from twist-off to pry-off caps a few years ago to combat leaking, infection, and oxidation. [Brookston Beer Blog 2007][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Question three**: Why is draught so much better?&#xD;&#xA;Very, very subjective, and you may want to clarify or qualify this in the future. Is good draught beer better than old, skunked bottled beer? Yes. Is good bottled beer better than flat draught beer poured through dirty lines? Also yes. Each has its pros and cons when it comes to service and storage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would venture to say that much of draught beer's appeal comes from it being special- you typically have to go somewhere else to get it in a way that's not usually available to the home user, like how the theater experience differs from the home movie experience. Yes, you can get bottled beer in bars, too, but it's still a more &quot;normal&quot; format. In terms of taste over experience, though, I don't know that you could say for sure without some sort of blind tasting with lots of variables (age, glass type, line cleanliness, CO2 pressure) controlled for. Even then, what does it for the tasters might not do it for you.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For further reading on all that goes into draught beer, check out the [Draught Beer Quality Manual][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.npr.org/2010/12/03/131785456/Searching-For-Science-In-A-Glass-of-Beer&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://brookstonbeerbulletin.com/sierra-nevadas-new-pry-off-cap/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.draughtquality.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/DQM_Full_Final.pdf" />

Of those 4 ingredients, 3 can cause issues with somebody who is sensitive (everything but water). As Tom said, if a person has Celiac's Disease, they're going to be sensitive to the gluten that that is in barley and wheat, which is why some breweries are offering an alternative (usually made with sorghum).  It's also possible that hops might be an issue for somebody sensitive.  I have a friend who is allergic to hops.  There are also folks who are sensitive to yeast. Both ale yeast and baker's yeast are Saccharomyces cerevisiae, so if somebody has trouble with yeast raised bread, they'll have trouble with beer too.  A yeast sensitivity can be mitigated by filtering the beer, but not all of it is captured.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All that said, I thought that I was going to get sick before I tried a certain maple bacon doughnut beer and surprisingly, I really enjoyed it.

Fortunately for us today, the monasteries in the beer-loving Belgium survived (or in cases like that of the [Rochefort Abbey][2], were restored).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Today, the &quot;Authentic Trappist Product&quot; logo, which defines a &quot;real&quot; Trappist beer, is owned by the International Trappist Association, an organization founded in 1997. The founding members include six abbeys from Belgium, one from the Netherlands, and one from Germany (which doesn't produce beer). It is only in very recent years that the ITA has expanded to recognize breweries aside from the original 7, the first &quot;new&quot; one being Stift Engelszell from Austria in 2012.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As the craft beer revolution pushes forward, I'd say we're likely to see more monasteries start their own beer production and apply for the logo. But right now, it's still mostly the original Belgians.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trappists&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochefort_Abbey" />

Under canon law this is permitted because La Trappe is the motherhouse of the Trappist Order. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trappists&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The history of the Trappist Foundation in 1997 is of a totally different perspective. Originally only La Trappe Abbey could grant the title of the label to those Trappist breweries which could safeguard the integrity of the Order. All other monasteries which could not or would not abide to the conditions to be met, would not be granted the Trappist Label. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trappist_beer&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since 2012, four other Trappist monasteries have been added to the list, including St. Joseph's Abbey in Massachusetts, United States.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The three basic rules for granting the label are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; -The beer must be brewed within the monastery, by the monks or at least under the supervision of the monks.&#xD;&#xA;  -The making of ales should be of a secondary importance to the monastery and should be seen as a witness of monastic life.&#xD;&#xA;  -Any profits from the brewery are to be use to help sustain the monks in their life of prayer.

Since so much of tasting depends on the nose aroma comes of as flavour too. By boiling hops most of the aroma disappears and your left with only bitternes.

(It's mashing, not meshing.)" Text="When yeast ferment the sugar into alcohol it produces a lot of different by-products that give beer most of it's flavour. The brewer can influence the by-products produces by controlling the temperature at which the fermentation takes place. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hops also add a lot in particular aroma. Since so much of tasting depends on the nose aroma comes of as flavour too. By boiling hops most of the aroma disappears and your left with only bitterness. By boiling hops for a shorter time, or not at all you can add more aroma. Brewers often talks about bittering vs aroma hops. Hops bitterness and aroma contribution depends on the variety of hops used. Hops growers are constantly coming up with new types of hops. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Malt, grain having been processed, also add flavour. Though most malt come from the same type of grain, barley, it can be processed/malted in many different ways giving a different flavour. When mashing (getting the sugar out of the malt and into the liquid) you can adjust the flavour by temperature. At high temperature (68c) you get almost only unfermentable sugar, which will give you a sweet result, while mashing at 64 will give you fermentable sugar and therefore a dry product. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Water does not add so much to the flavour in it self as it helps other parts of the recipe add a certain flavour. PH and content of minerals have a huge impact on mashing and fermentation." />

It depends heavily on the barrel itself (remember, it's wood, a biological element), the storage conditions of each of them (temperature, for example, which varies depending on the position of it in the warehouse) and some other random factors. So, the only way to achieve a consistent and reproducible product is blending, trying to fuse all those different characteristics in the right proportion, giving you an expected final product. In this process, is even common having to dump some barrels, which will not make it on the final proportion (maybe, let's say, you have too many very sour barrels, and you don't want your beer to be so that sour).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Additionally, another common practice is to blend aged beer with the young (not aged) version of it. Beers like Rodenbach, for example, are like this (Rodenbach Grand Cru has 2/3 of aged beer with 1/3 of fresh beer). Dogfish's Burton Barton is a blend of wood-aged and fresh IPA, as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, blending beer is not exactly a new thing. I understand that your question was about blending different styles of beers, which is still less common, probably because the brewers will try to do that from the beginning, with the ingredients, but is not an heresy. We should try doing this more often, I dare to say." />

It also depends on country's legislation or even the state, when it comes to USA. As far as I know, expiring dates for beers are even not obligatory by law in many american states.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Besides that, some breweries inform the bottling date, others the expiration date, which is less useful, because if you are a experienced drinker you know how old (or not) you want your beer to be, despite what the producer has estimated for it. So, in those cases, first you need to figure out the given shelf-life of it, and count backwards, to know when it was bottled. Pretty messy. I age beers and I'm quite used to it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, in general, when that information is not clear, your best (and maybe only) friend is the web - the brewery's website or forums.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, Anchor Brewery has a very particular (and weird) code standard for bottling date, but it is well explained on [their website][1].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The date code currently being used by Anchor Brewing Company (post-October 1991) replaces the clock-face that used to show the bottling month as one of 12 small notches around the main label. A three character code is now included on the new back label of the bottle. The code works like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The first character is always numeric and represents the last digit of the year. The second character is always alpha and represents the month by using the first letter of the month unless that letter has already been used:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; January: J, February: F, March: M, April: A, May: Y, June: U, July: L,  August: G, September: S, October: O, November: N, December: D&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The third character in the code is either alpha or numeric and tells the day of the month. The first 26 days are represented by the alphabet with the remaining days listed as:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 27th through 29th = 7 through 9, 30th = 3, 31st = 1&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; An example of a date code would be: January 20, 2012 = 2JT&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Not all breweries are so transparent like that, though. I have had a lot of trouble trying to figure out bottling date of some European beers, specially from some small, old breweries. Some american ones just won't tell anything about it as well, even on bottles.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.anchorbrewing.com/brewery/faqs" />

I'm not a specialist, but I think before the american craft beer revolution and revival in the early 80's, no one was gathering and classifying beer styles in a guide like BJCP. And that same revival brought back to life many dead styles in different fashion (well, look the case of IPAs), by the way.&#xD;&#xA; - Generally, despite style guides, people have their own understanding of what is X or Y, and when naming their beers, they will do it based on their perception and references too, not strictly style guidelines.&#xD;&#xA; - If you look closer, porter and stout are ancient reference styles for more specific and contemporaneous styles (sweet stout, dry stout, outmeal stout, brown porter, robust porter, russian imperial stout, etc).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, I think it makes more sense telling the difference between a milk and an outmeal stout, or brown and baltic porter than stout X porter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For what's worth, for me, there's no difference between stout and porter.

The keg to tap resistance must be matched by the gas tank push pressure. The gas pressure puts in a little CO2, the liquid line squeezes a little out. However, in long draw setups where the draft line has a lot of resistance the push pressure would have be so high that a lot more CO2 would be dissolved into the beer.  The amount of CO2 squeezed out would cause very foamy beer. How to solve this?  Mix in some Nitrogen.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Basically, the **Nitrogen will never blend into the beer.**  It is used as an inert gas to maintain the pressure in long draw lines.  Any change in carbonation would come from the mix ratio.  If the mix is too low in CO2, as the keg empties the beer will go flat since not enough CO2 is being forced in.  If the mix is too high in CO2 then the beer would gain carbonation from the beer gas.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Your ratio of 30% CO2 / 70% N is more suited to a Nitro tap setup.  Traditional nitro beers have an original carbonation level of around 1-1.5 volumes of CO2.  The amount of CO2 needed to maintain this carbonation level is minimal *PLUS* the faucets that pour these beers have an extra plate that restricts the flow even more, forcing almost all gas out of the beer.  Without that specialized faucet, the beer coming out would just be flat with maybe a few sad bubbles of CO2 but no thick head of foam that you'd expect.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.draughtquality.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/One-Pager-The-Facts-About-25-75-Gas1.pdf" />

Not only do we have a greater variety in styles, but we have more varieties of hops, malts, and different yeasts. These create wildly different flavor profiles unheard of centuries ago.

The common grain at the time was 6-row malt, today the most [common brewing barley is 2-row][1]. &#xD;&#xA;- Understanding of the malting process has drastically improved. Today we understand how to [get perfectly malted barley][2]. Historically the malt would have been over or under modified.  Under modified would have lots of unconverted starch which would leave a hazy beer that tasted rather bready. Over modified malt would would have no starch, but less sugar than possible so the resulting beer may lack body.&#xD;&#xA;- Kiln dryers allow for greater variety of malt. By controlling the heat cycle, the same variety of [barley can make different malt][3].  Drying the grain in medieval times consisted of heating it over a fire.  Fire dried grains would have a smokey flavor that would be present in the beer.  The traditional Scottish Ale uses malt that has been dried over a fire where the fuel is peat, which is a very distinct smoke flavor.  The fire also was not nearly as exact or even as a modern kiln so some kernels would be burnt and other may be under cooked, so to speak. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Water&#xD;&#xA;--&#xD;&#xA;- Needless to say, but water purity is drastcally better today than in the 6th-15th centuries.  Because the brewing process boils the water, the beer was safer to drink than the water. Hence the [patron saint of brewers][4] said &quot;Drink beer, not water.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;- Dissolved mineral content of water and pH control.  Medieval brewers had the water that they had.  Today, a brewer can start with distilled water and add whatever minerals they desire to change the flavor profile and pH of the mash.  The water pH can effect the mash efficiency and fermentation profile of the beer.  This lack of water control lead to specific styles coming from specific areas. I.E. Burton upon Trent is known for pale ales, Pilsen for golden pilsners, Munich for malty lagers.[Some water source mineral content.][5]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hops&#xD;&#xA;-&#xD;&#xA;- Ancient beers were not hoppy. Hops were not used extensively in beer until about the 12th century and were not cultivated en mass until about the [13th century][6].  [Most beers older than that were bittered with Gruit.][7].&#xD;&#xA;- The hops that were used were not high in bittering acids.  The oldest common hop varieties are the [Noble hops][8].  Just like today, costs of ingredients was a major factor in brewing.  Making a really hoppy beer was prohibitively expensive.  Just compare an English IPA brewed from old recipes vs. an American IPA.   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Yeast and Microbiology&#xD;&#xA;-&#xD;&#xA;- This is where modern technology really helps out.  Louis Pasteur discovered yeast in 1857. Up until that time, the changing of sugar into alcohol was considered magic or an act of god.  It was understood that the foam on top of a fermenting wort could be passed around to other vats of wort to start the process ([Krausening][9]). Others would transfer [Magic Sticks][13] from batch to batch to start fermentation.&#xD;&#xA;- There are other microorganisms that can inhabit beer. [Brettanomyces][10], [Lactobacillus][11], and [Pediococcus][12] to name a few.  These can cause a sour, acidic flavor in beer.  Some ancient breweries would just let the cold night air in through an open window in order to cool the freshly boiled wort, exposing the warm sugar solution to whatever might land on it.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Technology&#xD;&#xA;--&#xD;&#xA;- Thermometers - The temperature of the mash can affect the fermentabilty of the wort. The temperature of the malting and drying affect the sugar content of malted barley.&#xD;&#xA;- Chemical cleaners - All of the brewing equipment is sanitary. Modern living through chemistry.&#xD;&#xA;- Food storage/availability - I can get whatever ingredients I want, whenever I need them.&#xD;&#xA;- Refrigeration - I can cool the wort in controlled conditions. Beer can travel farther. I can ferment at optimal yeast temperature.&#xD;&#xA;- More than can possibly be named...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Result?&#xD;&#xA;===&#xD;&#xA;- Ancient beers would be sweeter and thicker than today's thanks to less fermentable sugars in the wort due to inconsistencies in the brewing process, and inconsistencies in the malting process and poor yeast/microorganism control.  The alcohol content would be lower as well.&#xD;&#xA;- Ancient beers would not be hoppy.&#xD;&#xA;- Ancient beers would have to be drunk quickly before they spoiled.  The other bugs in the beer would turn the beer bad after a few weeks.  This also prevented the beer from traveling very from from the brewery.&#xD;&#xA;- Ancient beers could vary greatly, batch to batch.  The brewers of the times were very skilled with what they could work with, but they were constrained by what ingredients they could use, whether by law or availability.  Flavor can be affected by fermentation temperature, so a hot day in December could ruin my beer.&#xD;&#xA;- Ancient beers were dependent on the season. When was the grain harvested? When is it cool enough to ferment?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Probably more information than you need, but hopefully it helps.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.homebrewersassociation.org/zymurgy/zymurgy-extra-2-row-vs-6-row-barley/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.brewery.org/brewery/library/Malt.html&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://hbd.org/brewery/library/Malt_AK0996.html&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_of_Soissons&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://howtobrew.com/book/section-3/understanding-the-mash-ph/balancing-the-malts-and-minerals&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://www.britishhops.org.uk/history-of-hops/&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://beer.stackexchange.com/a/4643/4637&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://beersmith.com/blog/2012/02/05/noble-hops-for-european-beer-styles/&#xD;&#xA;  [9]: http://www.homebrewersassociation.org/how-to-brew/exploring-the-german-technique-of-krausening/&#xD;&#xA;  [10]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brettanomyces_bruxellensis&#xD;&#xA;  [11]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus&#xD;&#xA;  [12]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediococcus&#xD;&#xA;  [13]: http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000103.html" />

Suppose that 1% ABV corresponded to 1 &quot;alcohol unit.&quot; If, for example, your body could process 4.5 alcohol units/hour, after 6 pints of a 5% ABV beer (1/hr), you'd have 3 alcohol units left in your body [(5.0-4.5)*6]. However, you'd reach the same mark after only 2 beers (1/hr) of a 6% ABV beer [(6-4.5)*2].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;TL;DR Version: It probably has to do with the beer's ABV you were drinking.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Side note: There is a lot of variability in strength within any given style. If you like IPAs, you should check out Session IPAs - They are IPAs designed to be lower in ABV than the average IPA, so you can drink more of them in a drinking &quot;session.&quot; For a list of the top Session IPAs and more information on the style, check out [Ratebeer's Session IPA page][2].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://lifehacker.com/why-a-5-beer-gets-you-drunk-so-much-faster-than-a-4-b-1725622428&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.ratebeer.com/beerstyles/session-ipa/121/" />

Sorghum appears to be the most popular ingredient for making GF beers, but there are a number of other options including buckwheat, millet, honey, even chestnuts.  Redbridge is an example of a GF beer.  IMO, sorghum gives off a cider-y flavor so I have not really enjoyed the sorghum-based beers.  Only gluten free beers that I've enjoyed are made by a Canada-based brewery called Glutenberg.  Their APA and IPA are fantastic.  Unfortunately, they don't currently distribute everywhere so I have to drive to a neighboring state to buy it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are also beers that are brewed with traditional ingredients that contain gluten, but an enzyme called Brewer's Clarex is added to primary fermentation.  Clarex was originally used to clear beer and prevent chill haze, but it was discovered it also breaks down gluten such that, when tested with traditional gluten tests (ELISA), the beer is well within the &quot;gluten free&quot; threshold (&lt;20 ppm).  These beers cannot be called &quot;gluten free&quot;, though, rather they can only be labeled &quot;crafted to remove gluten&quot;.  Omission brews &quot;gluten reduced&quot; beer (which are very good IMO), but apparently Yards also uses Clarex in some of their beers (even though they don't label their beer as &quot;crafted to reduce gluten&quot;)." />

Since goal here is homeostasis, we need to move heat out of the bottle and into the surrounding medium as quickly as possible.  And air, as it turns out, is a pretty lousy conductor.  So that makes your first friend most wrong.  Keeping the bottle dry will cool it eventually, but quite slowing.   However, ice isn't *that* much better.  Because there's a lot of air still touching the bottle when it's in ice.  It'll cool it better, but it's certainly still not the best option.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The best option, it turns out, is an ice water mixture, with a healthy dose of salt to help keep the water liquid, even below 0 degrees Celsius.  Water happens to be an excellent conductor, and with ice to keep it cold and salt to keep it liquid, can draw heat out of bottles faster than any other non-exotic method, by a significant margin.   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, if you want to cool your bottles quickly. and ice-water bath is the ticket.

These include acetic acid bacteria that consumes the alcohol in wine and metabolizes it into acetic acid and acetaldehyde. This causes the wine to have a sharp, vinegar-like smell.

It's primarily to extract compounds from the wood of the barrels (and any previous contents) so that they can add flavor and complexity to the final product.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From there, there are several factors that determine how long a typical aging period might be.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. If the wood in the barrels is new, or has been previously used.   Bourbon, which is typically aged as few as 4 years is aged in casks of new wood, meaning there are more compounds in the wood to be extracted, and they can be extracted more quickly.  Scotch, on the other hand, which is often aged from 10-25 years, is aged in previously used barrels, so it takes longer to extract the desired level of flavoring compounds.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. How much flavor you want the wood to add to the finished product.  A Rye, aged for 10 years, is going to have a lot more oak than you would want in say, an Anejo Tequila, which will often be aged for just a year or two.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 3.  The type of wood can have an impact as well.  Most whiskeys are aged in American or French oak, but if other woods are used, a tighter grain, or different wood chemistry can mean that you need more time in the barrel to the get the flavors that you want.

Since the goal here is homeostasis, we need to move heat out of the bottle and into the surrounding medium as quickly as possible.  And air, as it turns out, is a pretty lousy conductor.  So that makes your first friend most wrong.  Keeping the bottle dry will cool it eventually, but quite slowly.   However, ice isn't *that* much better.  Because there's a lot of air still touching the bottle when it's in ice.  It'll cool it better, but it's certainly still not the best option.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The best option, it turns out, is an ice water mixture, with a healthy dose of salt to help keep the water liquid, even below 0 degrees Celsius.  Water happens to be an excellent conductor, and with ice to keep it cold and salt to keep it liquid, can draw heat out of bottles faster than any other non-exotic method, by a significant margin.   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, if you want to cool your bottles quickly. and ice-water bath is the ticket.

Even better, unless you’re pouring something rare or expensive, buy an extra bottle and cook with it. When you’re cooking with red wine, watch out for tannins. When concentrated in reduction sauces, they can become harsh. Fortunately, proteins found in meat and dairy declaw tannins like milk does tea.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Wines contains sugars, acids, and tannins,][2] and each of these will show up on the plate. Subtle characteristics, by contrast, normally disappear with cooking. To maintain balance, check your recipe for acidic ingredients like lemon juice or vinegar and cut back to make room for the acid in the wine. This is especially crucial when cooking with white wine. For delicate fish or vegetables, a dry non-oaked wine works best. If your recipe is packed with onions, carrots and tomatoes, there will be plenty of sugars in the pot, so cooking with a fuller-bodied, less dry red or white wine can integrate perfectly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[For deeper flavors,][2] experiment with fortified wines like Port, Sherry, Madeira and Marsala. Michael Schachner offers some helpful tips and recipes on cooking with fortified wine in this piece.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Cook with a wine you would drink.][3] Do not use a wine to cook if you would never drink it in a glass or serve it with food. •Start with a basic red or white wine. An example of a good white to cook with is Sauvignon Blanc.

Contrary to popular belief tequila doest always give you the craziest hang over, at least not the newer tequilas since they are better quality, that is, if you are drinking **real** tequila. Real tequila is made from the agave plant and depending on the region grown in Mexico ( south, north) will have a slight different taste. Sometimes you may find tequilas that say *mixto* or mixed, **stay away** from these types since they are not pure tequila and should not be drank without mixing it in a cocktail or mix drink. This mixto tequila will not taste as good and will give you a crappy headache the next day. There are different types of aging process for tequilas. There is the silver, gold or aged and extra aged, all have distinct flavors and undertones. Here is a good link with some tequila information and history also for tasting.&#xA;So if the bottle says *mixed* or *mixto* then it's for mixing and should not be drank alone unless you want to feel like a truck hit you the next day.&#xA;Any other kind of *real* tequila should be ok, it all depends on taste and preference. &#xA;Just remember that the first swig you take **is** suppose to **burn**, lol enjoy!&#xA;&#xA;http://tequilaconnection.com/index.htm&#xA;&#xA;*this is just my opinion*&#xA;On a personal note, patron is over hyped and you can find way&#xA;Better quality tequilas at a better price.

Cinnamon is probably the most popular spice but you could also use cloves, cardamom (lightly crush a few pods) ginger and nutmeg. Some recommend star anise but use sparingly if you don't want your mulled wine to taste of aniseed. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most recipes call for sugar but you might want to add a little less than they suggest if your wine is particularly soft and fruity or if you add port.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Personally, I am very fond of cinnamon in my mulled wines at Christmas time. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.matchingfoodandwine.com/news/entertaining/how-to-mull-wine-the-tips-you-need-to-know/" />

Beef steak has lots of strong flavor from the meat itself and from smoke, marinade, sauce, or pepper, so it calls for choosing a wine that is also full-bodied. Cabernet Sauvignon’s robust fruit tastes and powerful flavors can stand up to most any steak. The tannins in Cabernet Sauvignon (coming mainly from the red skin of the grape)  and relatively high alcohol levels also help cut through the fat of the steak, making the wine taste smoother and less bitter… and the steak more flavorful.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**California Zinfandel**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;Zinfandel has moderate tannins and high acidity, making it a fitting match with steaks that contain relatively good amounts of fat. Rib Eye, T-Bone or Porterhouse steaks are ideal partners for Zinfandel. A little less refined than  Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel has a characteristically bold grapey spiciness and thick richness on the pallet.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Malbec** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;Malbec is an up and coming red wine that is definitely steak friendly. In fact, Malbec is the number one consumed red wine in Argentina where it’s considered the ideal wine to pair with beef.  Malbec is a versatile, rich and food-friendly red wine that may break with tradition but won’t break the bank. Check out Malbec wines from Argentina or Chile. You won’t be disappointed.&quot; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Other Good Red Wine Pairings with Steak**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;The classic wine choices to pair with grilled steaks are big, bold red wines, especially California Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec.  Merlot, Syrah (Shiraz from Australia), Sangiovese, Chianti and Pinot Noir are also good choices and will produce softer red wine and steak pairings, which you may prefer depending on the steak, the doneness you prefer and whatever else you are serving.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Rosés, Blush Wine and Sparkling Wines**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;Not to be forgotten, a crisp chilled Rosé wine or a bubbly Sparkling Wine (especially brut or rosé) is  almost always an enjoyable pairing with steak and other grilled fare. Just be sure to chill them in the refrigerator or on ice for several hours before serving. In fact, we recommend also chilling your red wines to avoid any “hot wine” influence on the taste of the steaks.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.wines.com/blog/classic-american-wine-pairings/" />

The micro- and homebrewing scene has been budding nicely in the last few years, the latest player being Segull 67.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## The Breweries ##&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In a category of their own are [Borg][1] and [Einstök][2]. These two operate under the wing of the two &quot;large&quot; local breweries (Egils and Víking), serving as their respective experimental departments. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * Borg keeps up a steady stream of new beers each year, easily Iceland's most &quot;prolific publisher&quot;. They have a steady production of the big-name styles (a lager, an IPA, a porter, etc.), and nearly always one or two beers on limited/temporary release.&#xD;&#xA; * Einstök produces the country's most widely sold ales, and seasonal varieties.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other microbreweries are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [Bruggsmiðjan][3]. Founded in 2006, they are the oldest microbrewery in Iceland (yup). They produce a line of Czech-style lagers, brand name Kaldi.&#xD;&#xA; - [Gæðingur][4]. Their gig is essentially similar to Borg's - steady production of big name styles, interspersed with experiments.&#xD;&#xA; - [Steðji][5]. Their lineup is a mix of very normal German-style lagers and some truly wacky stuff - for instance, their [infamous *whale beer*, Hvalur][6].&#xD;&#xA; - [Ölvisholt Brugghús][7]. ÖB is of the more established players, but their beers do not follow a particular trend that I have noticed. If anything, I could say they rely on beers &quot;with a twist&quot; more than the others, not many of their beers fall neatly into a common style.&#xD;&#xA; - [Segull 67][8]. Segull 67 is the newest and by far the smallest operating brewery. They released one beer in 2015, a dark lager.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At the time of writing, this list is exhaustive for operational breweries. In addition, I know of three breweries which will be opening &quot;any day now&quot;: Hún/Hann brugghús (in Reykjavík), Austri (in the eastern part of the country) and Hið austfirska bruggfélag (also in the eastern part of the country).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Brewpubs&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition to the breweries that sell nation-wide, there are a few who focus on their own premises.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * Bryggjan Brugghús, in Reykjavík near the harbor area. The only brewpub in Reykjavík, and unlike most Icelandic &quot;pubs&quot;, also operates an actual restaurant.&#xD;&#xA; * Brothers Brewery, in Vestmannaeyjar (islands off the south coast). It's the place to get craft beer in Vestmannaeyjar, apparently! Don't know much about it, unfortunately.&#xD;&#xA; * Bjórsetur Íslands, in Hólar (in the northern part of the country). This tiny establishment is the oldest brewpub by several years. It's basically run as a hobby - open on Fridays only. It is notable for its association with a beer festival (Bjórhátíð á Hólum), held annually at Hólar.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![Breweries, brewpubs and planned breweries in Iceland][9]][9]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Microbrews and Craft Beers on Tap ##&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Several bars pride themselves on selling Icelandic micro- and craft brews. These are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * Microbar. There are two bars operating under this name, one in downtown Reykjavík, the other in Sauðárkrókur. The one in Reykjavík is the pioneer of the Icelandic craft bar scene. It is owned by the Gæðingur brewery, and appropriately, you can always find Gæðingur beers on tap here (among other local beers)&#xD;&#xA; * Skúli Craft Bar, in downtown Reykjavík. It is notable for its diverse and rapidly rotating taps. At any given time, about half of them are likely to  be connected to local beers. The bar is independent, but beers from Borg brewery are always prominent in their choices. &#xD;&#xA; * Bjórgarðurinn, in Reykjavík. They have 22 taps, Icelandic craft beers always among them. They serve food other than bar snacks, mostly gourmet sausages that they recommend pairing with particular beers. It is a hotel bar, not associated with a brewery.&#xD;&#xA; * Kaldi Bar, in downtown Reykjavík. It is not owned by Bruggsmiðjan, but it brands itself as a place where you can get local beer, in particular, Bruggsmiðjan's Kaldi. This is, however, not a place I would call a *craft bar* that prides itself on a varied selection.&#xD;&#xA; * R5 Micro Bar, in Akureyri. I have not visited, but it's marketing itself as a craft beer bar. The locals seem impressed!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Micro/Craft beer fans will also want to know of Mikkeller &amp; Friends Reykjavík. Large tap selection there, but no focus on local produce.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Borg and Einstök taps can commonly be found interspersed with the common Egils and Víking taps. Steðji and Ölvisholt beers are only sporadically found on taps.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many other bars (but *definitely* not all) have some ambition when it comes to craft beer availability without making a particular deal of it. Hlemmur Square, a hostel/bar near the main bus station, is usually particularly well stocked. But always, ask your bartender!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Selected products ##&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Off the top of my head, here are a few items I consider distinctive - or at least, I have not found anything *quite* like them abroad.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Garún. Imperial stout, more heavy on the licorice than most.&#xD;&#xA; - Lava. A smoked imperial stout.&#xD;&#xA; - Snorri. An ale spiced with Icelandic thyme.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And always, keep an eye out for seasonal beers. The breweries usually allow themselves more creative freedom on those products. In 2014, we saw beers like the Einstök Arctic Berry Ale (beer flavored with Icelandic berries), Fenrir (an IPA smoked with sheep dung) and Hvalur (the whale beer mentioned earlier).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## General beer buying advisory ##&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You **won't** buy Icelandic beers in the supermarket. The things that look like beers in those shelves are low-alcohol versions. To buy beers, you must go to one of the state-operated [&quot;Wine stores&quot;][10] (Vínbúð). Beware of their opening hours - they are never open after 20:00, on Sundays, or on holidays.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Source: Icelandic beer enthusiast.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.borgbrugghus.is/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://einstokbeer.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.bruggsmidjan.is/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.gaedingur-ol.is/&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://www.stedji.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://www.stedji.com/hvalur-1-2.html&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://www.brugghus.is/&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://www.segull67.is/&#xD;&#xA;  [9]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/4I2ay.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [10]: http://www.vinbudin.is/" />

Refrigeration will decrease a bottle's temperature 4 to 5 degrees each half hour in the first 60-90 minutes. After that, temperatures will drop 2-3 degrees per half hour. Riesling should be chilled for 4 or 5 hours, a chardonnay for 1-2 hours, merlot for an hour and cabernets for a half hour or less. If time is short, a freezer will drop the temperature about 6-8 degrees every fifteen minutes.

Exposing wine to air for a short time, or allowing it to oxidize, can help soften flavors and release aromas in a way similar to swirling the wine in your glass. Young red wines, especially those that are high in tannin, such as Cabernet Sauvignon, most Red Zinfandel, Bordeaux and many wines from the Rhône Valley, actually taste better with aeration because their tannins soften and the wine becomes less harsh. Another method of aerating a young, tannic red wine is to roughly decant it into another container, which exposes more of the wine's surface to air than simply removing the cork from the bottle. Uncorking a bottle and letting it sit undisturbed for period of time actually does very little to let the wine breathe as only a small percentage of the wine is in contact with air. A much better suggestion is aerating the wine in your glass or in a wine decanter. A decanter is defined as any vessel other than the original bottle that will hold the contents of the wine and allow for air to mix with the wine within. Usually, these are broad-bottomed glass or crystal containers. &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt;  Wine and air may have a negative effect on each other. To simplify, let us consider the following: &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; • Wine poured from a bottle into a glass and swirled is positive since the air mixture allows aromas to be displayed&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; • Wine that has had a brief exposure to air is positive since it allows wine to breathe similar to stretching its legs after being cooped up in the bottle for so many years. This exposure has a positive effect on the wine after 25 to 30 minutes. Intensely tannic or younger reds may need up to a few hours. In general, most red and white wines will improve within the first half hour of opening the bottle. &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; • Extended exposure to air has a negative effect on the wine. After a day, the wine may obtain a vinegary smell or taste. Red wines and sweet white wines may last a little longer due to the natural preservatives of tannins and sugar. Refrigeration may be used to extend the life of white wine. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.totalwine.com/wine-guide/decanting-wine" />

Contrary to popular belief tequila doest always give you the craziest hang over, at least not the newer tequilas since they are better quality, that is, if you are drinking **real** tequila. Real tequila is made from the agave plant and depending on the region grown in Mexico ( south, north) will have a slight different taste. Sometimes you may find tequilas that say *mixto* or mixed, **stay away** from these types since they are not pure tequila and should not be drank without mixing it in a cocktail or mix drink. This mixto tequila will not taste as good and will give you a crappy headache the next day. There are different types of aging process for tequilas.

Text="&quot;[Wine experts][1] advise that white wines be served at 45 to 55 degrees Fahrenheit, light reds at about 60 degrees and more complex reds at &quot;room temperature&quot; or 65 to 70 degrees. [Remember, the phrase &quot;room temperature&quot; predates the days of central heat and air conditioning, so it generally refers to the &quot;cellar&quot; temperature of an earlier era.]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Chilling helps preserve and highlight fresh, fruity flavors of varieties like Riesling, Pinot Gris and Gewürztraminer. Chardonnay, on the other hand, though white, is more complex, is fermented and aged in oak barrels and thus is usually served at the upper end of the 'white' scale.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Full-bodied Cabernets should be served in the 70 degree range. The warmer temperature allows the complexity of intense reds to come through as they are swirled, sipped and savored. Lighter reds like chambourcin or merlot are less complex, so are best appreciated just slightly chilled.&#xD;&#xA;Full-bodied Cabernets should be served in the 70 degree range. The warmer temperature allows the complexity of intense reds to come through as they are swirled, sipped and savored.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In planning a festive gathering, consider several ways to attain the &quot;correct&quot; wine temperature. Refrigeration will decrease a bottle's temperature 4 to 5 degrees each half hour in the first 60-90 minutes. After that, temperatures will drop 2-3 degrees per half hour. Riesling should be chilled for 4 or 5 hours, a chardonnay for 1-2 hours, merlot for an hour and cabernets for a half hour or less. If time is short, a freezer will drop the temperature about 6-8 degrees every fifteen minutes. However, it is best to set a kitchen timer in the event the party is so festive that you forget and find a broken bottle of very fine wine in your freezer the next morning.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Sweet Moscato][2] and Moscato d'Asti wines are very good served chilled on their own as a refreshing summertime wine.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.seniorcitizensguide.com/articles/activities/wine-tips.htm&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://wines.com/sweet-wines.html" />

This lid was originally conceived entirely as a **sanitary measure**. During the summers of the late 1400s, hoards of little flies frequently invaded Central Europe. By the early 1500s, several principalities in what is now Germany had passed laws requiring that all food and beverage containers be covered to protect consumers against these dirty insects. The common mug also had to be covered, and this was accomplished by adding a hinged lid with a thumblift. This ingenious invention was soon used to cover all German beverage containers while still allowing them to be used with one hand. - [A Brief History of Beer Steins.][2] &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For more information one should read [The Beer Stein Book: A 400 Year History.][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubonic_plague&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.beerstein.net/articles/bsb-1.htm&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.amazon.com/beer-stein-book-illustrated-information/dp/1889591009" />

Bourbon tends to be amber-colored, and a little sweeter and heavier in texture than other whiskeys. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What make a bourbon a bourbon and not just an ordinary whiskey?

In his arsenal of weapons, the recruiting Sergeant offered any perspective recruit a bounty of over two month’s worth of wages to enlist. Some were offered the option to enlist for limited time of service, usually a 7-year term, and receive a smaller bounty, but most chose the other option: service for life. Calculating one’s options in life must have been difficult for the recruit in a noisy, smoke-filled Ale House after consuming a number of gills of rum, happily provided by a member of the recruiting party. While the recruiting prospect drank endless rounds from the punch bowl, his ears were filled with stories of an easy life as a soldier, quick promotion and how women to could not help but be drawn to a man in a red coat. &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt;The members of a recruiting party were all quite motivated in convincing say a young weaver or labourer to join as each was paid handsomely for each recruit they brought before the army surgeon for inspection and got attested by a Justice of the Peace. If the potential recruit hesitated to enlisted, deception was applied. A recruiting sergeant recounted:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt;…your last recourse was to get him drunk, and then slip a shilling in his pocket, get him home to your billet, and next morning swear he enlisted, bring all your party to prove it, get him persuaded to pass the doctor. Should he pass, you must try every means in your power to get him to drink, blow him up with a fine story, get him inveigled to the magistrates, in some shape or other, and get him attested; but by no means let him out of your hands.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Why the expression [To Take The King's Shilling:][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The expression 'to take the king's shilling', meant to sign up to join the army. Rather like with the 'prest' money for the 'impressed' man, a bonus payment of a shilling was offered to tempt lowly paid workers to leave their trade (an average daily wage during the Napoleonic period was 2p (at 12p to a shilling, this represented six days wages in one go). Once the shilling had been accepted, it was almost impossible to leave the army.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt;Since the army was not seen as an attractive career, recruiting sergeants often had to use less than honest methods to secure their 'prey', such as getting the recruitee drunk, slipping the shilling into his pocket and then hauling him before the magistrate the following morning (still hungover) to get him to accept the fact that he was now in the army. Sometimes the 'King's shilling' was hidden in the bottom of a pewter tankard (having drunk his pint, the unfortunate drinker found that he had unwittingly accepted the King's offer). As a result, some tankards were made with glass bottoms. Other recruits came from the courts, where a criminal's sentence could be commuted to service in the army - still the case (apparently) with the Blackwatch Regiment.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt;In fact the bounty for joining the army was much larger than a shilling. New recruits received £23.17s.6d, but out of this they were obliged to buy their uniform - a not inconsiderable expence.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here is a picture of the [King's Shilling Tankard][4] in question:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![King's Shilling Tankard][5]][5]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_shilling&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.warof1812.ca/recruit.htm&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.royalscotsgrenadiers.com/kingsshilling.html&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://shop.nmrn.org.uk/products/kings-shilling-tankard&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/CyhAq.jpg" />

A third less common type would be spontaneous fermentation (a natural beer fermentation process taking place in the wild). Typically, only one fermentation process occurs during production (either bottom, top, or spontaneous fermentation). It basically describes what happens to the yeast during fermentation- some yeast float to the top of the liquid during fermentation, while some types of yeast sink to the bottom. Which type of fermentation takes place, depends on the type of yeast used in the process. So to answer your question, if it effects the type of drink (and taste), the answer is yes. It's not so much whether the yeast sink to the bottom or float to the top that affects the taste/style, but it is rather due to the type of yeast which determines what will happen to during fermentation (float to top/sink to bottom). For instance, lager strains of yeast typically float to the bottom. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From Beeradvocate.com: &#xD;&#xA;&quot;Some of the lager styles made from bottom-fermenting yeasts are Pilsners, Dortmunders, Märzen, Bocks, and American malt liquors.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;Top-fermenting yeasts are used for brewing ales, porters, stouts, Altbier, Kölsch, and wheat beers.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A more in-depth summary:&#xD;&#xA;http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/101/yeast/" />

Text="&quot;Bottom fermentation&quot; is one of the two main types of fermentation which take place during beer production; the other being &quot;top fermentation&quot;. A third less common type would be spontaneous fermentation (a natural beer fermentation process taking place in the wild). Typically, only one fermentation process occurs during production (either bottom, top, or spontaneous fermentation). It basically describes what happens to the yeast during fermentation- some yeast float to the top of the liquid during fermentation, while some types of yeast sink to the bottom. Which type of fermentation takes place, depends on the type of yeast used in the process. So to answer your question, if it effects the type of drink (and taste), the answer is yes. It's not so much whether the yeast sink to the bottom or float to the top that affects the taste/style, but it is rather due to the type of yeast which determines what will happen to during fermentation (float to top/sink to bottom). For instance, lager strains of yeast typically float to the bottom. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From Beeradvocate.com: &#xD;&#xA;&quot;Some of the lager styles made from bottom-fermenting yeasts are Pilsners, Dortmunders, Märzen, Bocks, and American malt liquors.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;Top-fermenting yeasts are used for brewing ales, porters, stouts, Altbier, Kölsch, and wheat beers.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A more in-depth summary can be seen at the [Beer Advocate's Yeast Guide.][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/101/yeast/" />

But this depends on how you define mainstream lagers. Different lager styles definitely taste different, but the reason mainstream lagers all taste the same is because they're all pretty much the same style of lager- American lager, and are all probably brewed in a similar fashion (what those in the industry call &quot;macro brews&quot;).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For instance, coors light, bud light, keystone light are all the same style of lager, just different brands of the same brew.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But to taste the difference between different styles of lagers, try a budweiser and compare it to a Pilsner Urquell (it's a Euro pilsner- another lager style). The bud will taste light, bready and slightly sweet, while the pilsner will taste crisp, somewhat floral, and slightly bitter on the finish (and definitely way better imho).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since craft beers are made in small batches with brewmasters experimenting with different flavours through use of various hops (flavouring agents), I'd recommend trying craft lagers if you want to experience the difference lager styles and flavours within a style. A brooklyn lager definitely tastes different/better than a Budweiser, even though they're both of the American Lager style." />

Clearly the U.S. government is struggling with the issue as much as you are. Today’s science is capable of measuring imperfections in a spirit. So rather than insisting that 190 proof is an adequate minimum to guarantee quality in vodka, other metrics might have been considered in the TTB’s rule-making. For instance, some successful brands add sugar or glycerin to their vodkas to “smooth” them out. Never mind that these spirits throw any standard cocktail recipe completely out of balance. The larger question is: why do they need to add these softeners? What are they covering up? If they focused upon good raw ingredients and clean distillation they could achieve the same result. But perhaps that’s asking too much; it always comes back to economics.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt;Other countries are demanding that producers note upon the label any additions such as sugar or glycerin; the TTB hasn’t wised up yet. **It will probably be a while before those additives are visible on the vodka labels, but until then, taste the stuff yourself.** If it tastes sweet, it probably is, and you may want to alter any cocktail recipes that you’re working from.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Absolut Raspberri][2] is just one example of a flavoured vodka that does not contain added sugar!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Absolut Raspberri is made exclusively from natural ingredients, and unlike some other flavored vodkas, it doesn’t contain any added sugar.

As an added bonus, these are not typically consumed ice-cold. For mixed drinks, lowballs (cocktails that are mostly liquor) are a good choice. Order them neat or straight (no ice) to avoid dilution.

In fact Greek wine was highly praised by the Romans and incorporated viticulture into their own culture, thanks to the Greeks. The white  [Retsina][1] or [Resinated wine][2] of the ancient Greeks is still produced in Greece and is locally very popular. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are a few wineries in Europe, notable Italy that make a claim (loosely) of producing a truly **Roman wine**, but interpretation is still left to the reader.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First of all, there is the [Cesanese Wine][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Cesanese could have been the local wine of ancient Rome.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt;•It’s quite possible that Cesanese was the red wine of ancient Rome because the grape is quite old and existed in the region during pre-Roman times.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt;•However, there is no physical records to prove this, just ampelography (the study of grapes).&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt;•Evidence of Cesanese dates back to the 1400s from agricultural contracts that were preserved in local monasteries.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt;•There are only about 1500 acres of Cesanese vineyards left around Rome and the province of Frosinone in Lazio, Italy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A second possibility is [Frascati Wine][4]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The Romans referred to it as the Golden Wine both for its color and its value.  It has become embedded in the cultural and economic traditions of the city.  In fact, in 1450, there were 1,022 taverns in Rome.  Producers of Frascati owned almost all of the taverns.  It has been said that Frascati is the most often mentioned wine in Italian literature.  Pope Gregori XVI, in the first part of the 18th century, said it was his favorite wine.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt;The wines made in close proximity to Rome are collectively known as Castelli Romani, nine communes that produce wine in the Alban Hills, which are just south of Rome.  The vineyards range from 200 to 1,000 feet in altitude.  The Soils are well drained and volcanic.  The Mediterranean provides some influence but the climate is more affected by the hills.  Of these, Frascati is the most famous.  It has historically had a widespread reputation as an inexpensive and serviceable white wine served in the cafés of Rome.  The potential, however, is there to really improve the wines.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Mas des Tourelles][5] offers some unique **“Archeological Roman Wines”**:  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;These wines are only available in France (and in few quantities in Germany).&#xD;&#xA; As many people contacted us to have informations on the way to buy and taste these wines in the US, you should know that it is hard to export wines without having a registered importer. It need also that this company can after deal with a reseller that can work with all the states.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Mulsum**&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt;Like testifying the passages of Pline the eldest, the blend of wine, honey and a certain number of plants ans spices (cinnamon, pepper, thyme ect...) are usedin making this famous wine, which was often served to the « gustatio » (before the meal as an aperitif).&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt;However, it also accompanies filet of duck with figs, small quails with grapes and pine kernels, very spicy dishes, Roquefort or chocolate fondant.

The addition of seawater, fenugrec, defrutum (grape juice concentrated to boiling point) ect..., during the vinification makes an amazing and complex wine. Roman dishes, such as oysters ans smoked fish, are wonderful with our wines of recent years.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt;However, in the years of 2746 - 2747, you will be able to serve it with fried foie gras or cakes with nuts. To serve at 18°. « The fenugrec confers it to the particular « vin Jaune » taste and it has a detectable smell due to the notes of nuts and almonds. The taste of the Turriculae proves to be rich and supple with a round prune flavoured finish.&#xD;&#xA; (La Revue des Vins de France - Mai 1999)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Carenum**&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt;This sweet wine, described by Palladius, is produced by fermenting very mature grapes with plants, quince and defrutum. A delicately viscous and silky wine notes of quince and subtle aromas of crystallised peaches, it is a wonderful accompaniment with “foie gras” and fruit tarts.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt;To serve at 14°. « The wine is of an amber colour, and its smell hesitates between peach and caramel. These smoky and caramel notes are also present in its mellowt taste. It makes a very nice aperitif ».&#xD;&#xA; (La revue des Vins de France - Mai 1999)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To make things a little more interesting it could be noted that [Italian Scientists have planted vineyards with the aim of making wine using techniques from classical Rome described by Virgil.][6]  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Archeologists in Italy have set about making red wine exactly as the ancient Romans did, to see what it tastes like.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt;At the group's vineyard, which should produce 70 litres at the first harvest, modern chemicals will be banned and vines will be planted using wooden Roman tools and will be fastened with canes and broom, as the Romans did.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt;Instead of fermenting in barrels, the wine will be placed in large terracotta pots – traditionally big enough to hold a man – which are buried to the neck in the ground, lined inside with beeswax to make them impermeable and left open during fermentation before being sealed shut with clay or resin.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retsina&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resinated_wine&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://winefolly.com/update/drink-like-true-roman-wine-lazio/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.intowine.com/frascati-wine-when-rome-drink-what-romans-drink&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://www.tourelles.com/spip.php?article116&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/22/italy-wine-archaeology" />

However, it does offer gin recommendations for various types of gin. Their number one all around recommendation is in fact **Greylock.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**1. Plymouth** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Plymouth is technically both a style and a brand – how’s that for pizzazz? Plymouth is remarkably gentle. It has a sweet, delicate nose and a woodsy, lemony body. You might even get a bit of cinnamon bark on the palate. The finish is quite smooth, making Plymouth ideal for the bare bones martini. If the idea of drinking a cocktail that’s basically straight liquor freaks you out, Plymouth is a great gin to start with. It’s so welcoming, the first few sips of your martini might evolve into gulps. Drink cautiously.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**2. Bombay Sapphire**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;This is about as old timey as it gets. Savory, agreeable, and wonderfully cohesive, Bombay Sapphire is a gin that was born to hang out in a martini. While this low-key gin runs the risk of getting lost in fruitier cocktails, it rests perfectly alongside vermouth to create a balanced martini. Sapphire’s traditional botanicals (like coriander and grains of paradise) latch onto one another to make something great. Think of Sapphire as the perfect chocolate chip cookie: it seems simple, but one taste of a failed contender tells you it ain’t.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**3. Citadelle BEST ON A BUDGET**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;If you’re at a great bar and ask for a basic gin cocktail off-menu, there’s a good shot you’ll be tasting Citadelle. This French gin is a great quality purchase. Plenty of orange and overall citrus give Citadelle a nice burst of fruitiness without being fruit forward per se. While there are some floral notes to work with here, Citadelle really straddles the line between unique and eccentric, making it a great choice for a more aromatic, flavor-packed martini. Plus, at around $25, you don’t have a lot to lose. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**4. Euphrosine #9**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;All right, so Euphrosine #9 isn’t exactly traditional. In fact, it’s like you took the floral notes in Citadelle and pumped them up a notch (or three). Still, there’s enough palatable sweetness to make Euphrosine #9 a happy martini gin. If you’re looking for a martini that’s on the sweeter side, reach for this NOLA-born pick from producer Atelier Vie. You’ll pick up on hibiscus, berries, and sweet iced tea. Dare we say it, there’s something rather flirtatious about Euphrosine.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**5. The Botanist**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Hey, here’s something from Islay that isn’t Scotch! Bruichladdich crafts this interesting gin, which is made from thirty-one botanicals, twenty-two of which are native to Islay. While that may seem like an overwhelming amount of botanicals when compared to the standard seven or eight, The Botanist holds itself together surprisingly well. This is a complex gin, with a floral nose and an herbal palate. We get chamomile, mint, and citrus zest. Because this gin is so layered, you might want to add even less vermouth than usual. When it comes to your standard martini, The Botanist will really do all the talking, and in this case, that’s okay.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**6. Gin Mare**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Do you prefer your martinis dirty? Then use Gin Mare. Seriously, this Spanish gin seems to be genetically engineered for a dirty martini. In a rare instance where branding fits product, Gin Mare is a Mediterranean gin made with olives, thyme, and rosemary amongst other herbs. The viscosity of the gin, combined with its garden-fresh taste, makes it the ideal spirit for a martini with just a hint of olive tartness. With this spicy yet still contained gin, you’ll feel like you’re going beyond a basic martini. Gin Mare is a great example of how a spirit can be both contemporary and classic at the same time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**7. Terroir**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Made from the gorgeous distillery at St. George’s Spirits, Terroir gin uses local Douglas fir. Unsurprisingly, Terroir gin was created as an homage to California’s natural resources. While drinking “fir” might put you off at first, it seems that the plant works to intensify the juniper, giving us a gin that has classic pine notes. This gin has a generous layer of crisp juniper bite, yet there’s a certain earthiness to it that prevents it from being too harsh or simplistic. Expect grassy notes, moss, tree sap, and of course, a heavy coat of juniper to round this all up. Like Bombay Sapphire, this gin is as solid as a California redwood.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**8. Greylock BEST OVERALL**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;This mighty gin from Berkshire Mountain Distillers has received tons of praise – and rightfully so. Straightforward, London Dry, and clean as a whistle, Greylock is a fantastic martini gin. Spicy licorice combined with lemon peel, black pepper, and a touch of cooking spice make Greylock both approachable and complex. Greylock will add lip-smacking flavor to your martini while still boasting enough unique spiciness to make your cocktail truly special. A hint of sugar-coated juniper berry will give way to just enough sweetness to make your martini quaffable as can be. This is an A+ gin for making martinis – we guarantee your guests will be happy with this crowd-pleaser.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**9. Dorothy Parker**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Named after satirical poet and general snark icon Dorothy Parker, this gin from New York Distilling Company would make Ms. Parker proud. Similar to Euphrosine #9, the floral nose is rich with hibiscus, elderflower, pear, and cranberries. The juniper peaks its head around on the blooming palate and the finish, which is zesty. While this is half a world away from Greylock, it’s perfect if you’re looking to whip up a martini that’s a little lighter, bubblier, and of course, a bit more tart – like Ms. Parker herself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Recommendation are always a hard subject to put across to others because what one person may enjoy, another may find less than favorable!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Town and Country Magazine][2] offers their **5 of the Best Gins for a Classic Martini.** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1.

Generally speaking, cask ale (as opposed to pressurised keg beer) is served, in the UK at least, and according to CAMRA's website, at cellar temperature: 12-14 C (54-57 F), whereas lager and keg beer is usually served much colder.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So much for the purist. My preference is always for cask ale to be served cool, but not cold, so that the flavours can be properly appreciated. Good quality lager should be served colder, and I prefer Czech pilsners at around 6-8 C - about the same temperature as you'd want white wine to be. But on a burning hot day in the African sunshine (where I'm from), there is nothing as refreshing as an ice-cold (and I mean **ice**-cold) ordinary mass-market lager, straight out of the bottle. You can't distinguish tastes as readily at those temperatures. Refreshment is the key there: you don't really care about taste in those circumstances (if you did you'd be drinking something else)." />

The biggest is that TCP only measures a specific component of smoke flavor, and in fact one of somewhat less importance. TCP is responsible for the sharp, chemical smoke flavor. However, [polycyclic aromatics][2] are responsible for the majority of &quot;smoke&quot; flavor. In fact, many fuels, such as wood, create relatively low proportions of TCP compared to peat. As such, it is more of a ballpark figure, and even then only if you are discussing alcohols smoked with the same fuels.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Because of those different compounds, the actual nature of smoke flavors vary wildly depending on the fuel and its origin, not just how much of it is used. Here are some examples of how I would classify the smoke flavor of various alcohols:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Laphraoig: Cigar smoke&#xD;&#xA; 2. Ardbeg: Bonfire, &quot;iodine&quot;&#xD;&#xA; 3. Highland Park: Bacon&#xD;&#xA; 4. Octomore: Chemical, biting&#xD;&#xA; 5. Vita (Mezcal, not Scotch): A forest fire&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As implied by the terminology I chose, it can be difficult to separate the smoke taste from the other tastes involved. There is even disagreement as to what constitutes &quot;smoke&quot;/&quot;peatiness&quot; - are &quot;iodine&quot; and/or &quot;phenol&quot; part of it, or entirely separate? If they are separate, can people reasonably separate them in tasting?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am skeptical how useful a number could possibly be with the wide variety of smoke flavors to discuss. It's not just that the number would amalgamate many distinct flavors, it's also that different people are differently sensitive to the varying flavor compounds and might find the numbers ill-represent their actual experience because of that. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As such, any number you might come up with is going to have a wide margin of error, since no one is going to agree on how &quot;smokey&quot; a given alcohol is.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is of course theoretically possible to generate a number based on analysis of many different flavor compounds. However, that has not been done, and likely will not be. Even if it was, people would still have differing sensitivities. The closest you are likely to get is TCP ppm measurements and arbitrary numbers offered by reviewers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2,4,6-Trichlorophenol&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbon" />

There’s a chart below outlining which styles are served at what temperature, but as a general rule the temperature at which to serve a beer is correlated to the strength of the beer. **As beers go up in alcohol, they are generally drunk at a warmer temperature.** This is because stronger beers often are sipped slowly, and enjoyed for their complexity of flavor and aroma while weaker beers are often consumed for refreshment. For no style is this more apparent than American macro lagers, which are generally drunk so cold that you can’t taste them.

While the glass of most bottles blocks some UV, any getting through is extremely harmful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Something else that can be done is to transfer partially filled bottles into smaller bottles.

This would reduce surface area and the amount of air in the bottle.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you are committed to preserving a bottle that you do not often use, wine stores sell cans of Xenon which can be sprayed into bottles. The Xenon is heavier than air and covers the surface, preventing oxygen from coming in contact with the liquid.

By German law, Weißbiers brewed in Germany must be top-fermented. Specialized strains of yeast are used which produce overtones of banana and clove as by-products of fermentation. Weißbier is so called because it was, at the time of its inception, paler in color than Munich's traditional brown beer. It is well known throughout Germany, though better known as Weizen (&quot;Wheat&quot;) outside Bavaria. The terms Hefeweizen (&quot;yeast wheat&quot;) or Hefeweißbier refer to wheat beer in its traditional, unfiltered form. The term Kristallweizen (crystal wheat), or kristall Weiß (crystal white beer), refers to a wheat beer that is filtered to remove the yeast and wheat proteins which contribute to its cloudy appearance." />

It's rooted in the tradition of German Eisbock style, though in an Eisbock the technique is used to considerably concentrate the alcohol (alcohol percentages in the final product can range from 10%, to over 50%) whereas when a modern mild lager-based Ice beer probably doesn't gets only a small increase in ABV.  The one you link to in the question, for instance, is only 5.2% alcohol.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The process involves bringing the beer down to a temperature below the freezing point of water so that ice crystal form, and then drawing those crystals out.  This process is repeated until the beer reaches the desired strength, and in the case of Ice beer, that's probably not many times.  The goal is that when you remove the crystals, the remaining drink is both more alcoholic and has more pronounced flavors, and you can allegedly remove impurities, as I suppose they may serve as nucleation sites for the crystal formation.

That process is called malo-lactic fermentation, and here's the quick take on how it works.  Just after the grapes are made into wine, a special type of beneficial bacteria is added to the wine.  That bacteria converts one of the acids in wine (malic) to another type of acid (lactic).  The two acids feel different on the tongue.  Malic acid is very sharp (it's the acid in a Granny Smith apple); lactic acid is fairly soft (it's the acid in milk).  Most Chardonnay's go through malo-lactic fermentation and are therefore soft and buttery.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[enter link description here][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.blueskyvineyard.com/why-do-wines-taste-buttery" />

CaraVienne and CaraMunich are two possible belgian caramel malt choices. They only use one belgian caramel malt but which one they use is a secret so I figured it would be best to use a little of each (Sean Paxton does the same in his clone).&#xD;&#xA;- Carafa III is used mainly for some color (the candi syrup isn't dark enough alone) and for some aroma and body and flavor stability.&#xD;&#xA;- It isn't possible to get the real light and dark candy sugar used by Rochefort and I feel that D2 and amber candi syrup are the highest quality and closest we can get.&#xD;&#xA;- Sugars are reportedly 20% of the fermentables (as they are in my recipe)&#xD;&#xA;- Rochefort says they use wheat starch (used to be corn) which should add some dryness and some head retention and body. Sean Paxton says it is about 5% of the fermentables (as it is my recipe).&#xD;&#xA;- Sean Paxton claims they use 3 step mash is used with a protein rest at 122 and a saccharification rest in the &quot;mid-low 150s&quot;. 153 seemed to be a good number in the mid-low 150s.&#xD;&#xA;- While Rochefort likely doesn't use a decoction mash, I've found that decoction mashes give better efficiency, better flavor, and better fementability for a minimal amount of additional effort.&#xD;&#xA;- The bittering hops are the &quot;traditional belgian hops&quot;. I'm guessing Styrian Goldings. The flavor hops are a German hop. I'm guessing Hallertauer Hersbrucker. The hops are fairly subtle in this beer so those guesses are likely close enough if they aren't correct.&#xD;&#xA;- Rochefort centrifuges and bottles rather quickly but since most homebrewers don't have access to a centrifuge, 6 weeks of cold conditioning should suffice.&#xD;&#xA;- A starter should be used, but should be slightly under-pitched in order to get the yeast to produce the desire esters.&#xD;&#xA;- Still not sure on the amount of flavor hops vs bittering hops but IBUs should be 27 according to BLAM.&#xD;&#xA;- I'm tempted to pitch colder at 65 and let rise to 80 as I do with Westmalle yeast but I'm not sure if that will work with Rochefort yeast or if I'll get horrible fusel alcohols. For now, I'll try 68-73 as Rochefort does.&#xD;&#xA;- Rochefort ferments beers on top of older beers. I wonder if this is possible to replicate by starting with pitching into just 1/4 of the wort and adding an additional 1/4 more wort each day for three days. Probably not worth experimenting with this on the first attempt but might help with attenuation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sorry for the different formatting- the recipes came from different sites with different standards.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://beerrecipes.org/showrecipe.php?recipeid=1241&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.homebrewtalk.com/showthread.php?t=227735&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://www.cicerone.org/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.bjcp.org/" />

CaraVienne and CaraMunich are two possible belgian caramel malt choices. They only use one belgian caramel malt but which one they use is a secret so I figured it would be best to use a little of each (Sean Paxton does the same in his clone).&#xD;&#xA;- Carafa III is used mainly for some color (the candi syrup isn't dark enough alone) and for some aroma and body and flavor stability.&#xD;&#xA;- It isn't possible to get the real light and dark candy sugar used by Rochefort and I feel that D2 and amber candi syrup are the highest quality and closest we can get.&#xD;&#xA;- Sugars are reportedly 20% of the fermentables (as they are in my recipe)&#xD;&#xA;- Rochefort says they use wheat starch (used to be corn) which should add some dryness and some head retention and body. Sean Paxton says it is about 5% of the fermentables (as it is my recipe).&#xD;&#xA;- Sean Paxton claims they use 3 step mash is used with a protein rest at 122 and a saccharification rest in the &quot;mid-low 150s&quot;. 153 seemed to be a good number in the mid-low 150s.&#xD;&#xA;- While Rochefort likely doesn't use a decoction mash, I've found that decoction mashes give better efficiency, better flavor, and better fementability for a minimal amount of additional effort.&#xD;&#xA;- The bittering hops are the &quot;traditional belgian hops&quot;. I'm guessing Styrian Goldings. The flavor hops are a German hop. I'm guessing Hallertauer Hersbrucker. The hops are fairly subtle in this beer so those guesses are likely close enough if they aren't correct.&#xD;&#xA;- Rochefort centrifuges and bottles rather quickly but since most homebrewers don't have access to a centrifuge, 6 weeks of cold conditioning should suffice.&#xD;&#xA;- A starter should be used, but should be slightly under-pitched in order to get the yeast to produce the desire esters.&#xD;&#xA;- Still not sure on the amount of flavor hops vs bittering hops but IBUs should be 27 according to BLAM.&#xD;&#xA;- I'm tempted to pitch colder at 65 and let rise to 80 as I do with Westmalle yeast but I'm not sure if that will work with Rochefort yeast or if I'll get horrible fusel alcohols. For now, I'll try 68-73 as Rochefort does.&#xD;&#xA;- Rochefort ferments beers on top of older beers. I wonder if this is possible to replicate by starting with pitching into just 1/4 of the wort and adding an additional 1/4 more wort each day for three days. Probably not worth experimenting with this on the first attempt but might help with attenuation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sorry for the different formatting- the recipes came from different sites with different standards.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://beerrecipes.org/showrecipe.php?recipeid=1241&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.homebrewtalk.com/showthread.php?t=227735&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://www.cicerone.org/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.bjcp.org/" />

Text="As for butter  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many white wines undergo a process that causes them to take on buttery flavors (which sometimes come across as buttered popcorn or even butterscotch).  That process is called malo-lactic fermentation, and here's the quick take on how it works.  Just after the grapes are made into wine, a special type of beneficial bacteria is added to the wine.  That bacteria converts one of the acids in wine (malic) to another type of acid (lactic).  The two acids feel different on the tongue.  Malic acid is very sharp (it's the acid in a Granny Smith apple); lactic acid is fairly soft (it's the acid in milk).  Most Chardonnay's go through malo-lactic fermentation and are therefore soft and buttery.

When I was getting into craft beer it was an organic process: I'd try something new, see if I liked it, then I'd try something else, and the process would continue. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Eventually my exploration became intentional: I wasn't that familiar with different styles, I just tried as many new beers as I could, and eventually found my niche. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In retrospect, if I could do it all over again with some guidance I'd want to have some understanding of styles. In general you have your dark ales stouts/porters/imperials, your lights standard lager/pilsner, your pale ales, your wheat ales, some fruity beers, some spiced beers, and whatever I'm missing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So what you could do to start is do some research and find a good example of 4-5 different styles that interest you and that are available locally, and get an idea of which type of beer you like. After you figure out the type of beer you're interested in you could buy more examples of those styles and find which ones you like best.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A few notes that I'd keep in mind though:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Going from generic drinks to more 'complex' beers can be a challenge to the taste buds. At first try you might find some beers off putting, but after a while they grow on you. For that reason it'd also be smart to ease into beers with heavier flavour, until you're ready to approach them with an open mind and a palate that's used to new flavours. Try some balanced IPAs, wheat ales, some pilsners, maybe something sweet if you like first, go from there.&#xD;&#xA; 2. I've always found the beer I drink changes with the seasos. What goes best in cold weather isn't the same thing that goes best in warm weather. So that could affect your judgement of what you try" />

Others have started to go off after six months or a year (but were fine before that).  The meads are bottled in capped (usually) 12oz brown bottles stored in a dark basement, and it doesn't seem to be about individual bottles.  This seems to be a case of &quot;some recipes keep longer than others&quot;.  I'd like to know what properties contribute to this.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So far, the batch that has kept well for the longest (over 10 years now! I've been saving the last few bottles...) was *very* high-gravity for a mead; it's strong, sweet, and very smooth.  But another moderately-high-gravity mead degraded after a year or so, and lower-gravity ones have sometimes lasted longer.  So it seems like there must be other factors at play; it doesn't seem to be as simple as &quot;stronger (or sweeter) meads keep longer&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Our production techniques have been about as consistent as home-brewing can be -- same equipment, same general process, same cellars, same fastidiousness about sanitation.  Varieties of honey and yeast have varied, and of course recipes have too.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is not a home-brewing question; I'm not asking specifically how to *make* long-lived mead.

Text="Ale yeast strains are best used at temperatures ranging from 10 to 25°C, though some strains will not actively ferment below 12°C (33). Ale yeasts are generally regarded as top-fermenting yeasts since they rise to the surface during fermentation, creating a very thick, rich yeast head. That is why the term &quot;top-fermenting&quot; is associated with ale yeasts. Fermentation by ale yeasts at these relatively warmer temperatures produces a beer high in esters, which many regard as a distinctive character of ale beers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Top-fermenting yeasts are used for brewing ales, porters, stouts, Altbier, Kölsch, and wheat beers. *&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Lager yeast strains are best used at temperatures ranging from 7 to 15°C. At these temperatures, lager yeasts grow less rapidly than ale yeasts, and with less surface foam they tend to settle out to the bottom of the fermenter as fermentation nears completion. This is why they are often referred to as &quot;bottom&quot; yeasts. The final flavour of the beer will depend a great deal on the strain of lager yeast and the temperatures at which it was fermented. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some of the lager styles made from bottom-fermenting yeasts are Pilsners, Dortmunders, Märzen, Bocks, and American malt liquors.* &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(All information from [BeerAdvocate][1].)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.beeradvocate.com/" />

Beers like Becks, Heineken, Amstel, Yuengling, Miller/Coors/Budweiser, etc. aren't as strongly hopped as IPAs.  Nonetheless, hops are still the primary flavoring agent in these beers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some background first.  Hops are flowers.  Their bitter flavor comes from the release of the flower's alpha acids, which are among the most prominent resins and volatile oils within the flower itself.  These alpha acids are extremely sensitive to oxygen and begin to break down upon exposure to oxygen -- even the trace amounts inside a sealed bottle or keg.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thus, any beer relying on hops as a primary flavoring agent is essentially &quot;on the clock&quot; from the time it's brewed.  When fresh (&lt;30 days after bottling/kegging), these hops taste as they were intended.  As time progresses, the hop flavors fade and are replaced by a skunky hop flavor which some people (myself included) perceive as being overly bitter.  Advanced palates can distinguish between these flavors, but it's often difficult to separate them without proper training.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Additionally, most mass-market beers (including all of the above) are pasteurized.  Anything that's been pasteurized will have a shelf life.  General guidelines are to avoid anything older than ~90 days for pasteurized beer, and try to find &lt;30 days when possible.  I check bottling dates religiously before making a purchase.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that some types of unpasteurized beer (Ex: traditional Belgian lambic) actually *improve* with age and can be cellared under proper conditions for upwards of 30 years!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another reason is due to the Heineken flavor profile itself.  Just as alpha acids are sensitive to oxygen, the malted grain in beer is quite sensitive to direct sunlight.  Even 15-20 minutes of exposure to the sun can irreparably skunk a beer.  This is why most beer bottles are dark in color and 6pk holders have high cardboard sides.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even though both Becks and Heineken are sold in green bottles, which allow significantly more light through than dark bottles, the Heineken flavor profile is decidedly more skunky.  And that's not to say it's bad; it's simply part of the flavor profile they have nurtured.  This skunky malt flavor is the dominant flavor in Heineken, and it frequently masks some of the underlying hop bitterness -- including bitterness from aged hops.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you want to see what this flavor tastes like, grab two cans of Bud/Miller/Coors Light.  Pour one into a clear glass and put it in direct sunlight for 15-20 minutes.  Pour the other one at the same time but leave it in an opaque container shielded from sunlight.  It's a pretty distinctive flavor.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, everyone's tastebuds perceive flavors a little differently.  It's entirely possible that another person tasting the same two beers from the exact same bottles comes to a different conclusion about bitterness.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In short, there are a number of factors at play here, and it may require a bit of effort to isolate them.  But hey, that's the fun part!" />

To do this in the bottle i. e. to simply uncork or unscrew the bottle and leave it is virtually pointless. The surface area of the wine exposed, coupled with the poor gas-liquid transfer means any change would in all likelihood, be undetectable. There would be more aeration occurring by the simple act of pouring the wine into a glass. The best method is to swirl the wine in a vessel. A wide decanter is best, but leave settling time (of solids) for older wines. A wide wineglass (where the glass is about the width of a bottle)  also works.  Ideally,  one would pour the wine into decanter where the volume of wine places the liquid level at the widest part of the vessel.  A good swirl maximises aeration /oxidation.  Give it time before pouring without the temperature rising too much above the ideal. Then, pouring from decanter to glass aerates further. This method is especially true for red wines. For white wines, more effective aeration is enacted by sucking the wine through the front teeth with air (almost slurping but only once the wine is in the front part of the mouth) while sipping from the glass.  For tannic reds, this method can leave a &quot;furry&quot;  feeling on the teeth however. " />

It seems so strange that in BC there is a regular list of products sold in liquor stores as well as a restricted list for restaurants and a specialty list where one can buy products providing one buys the whole box. Some private liquor store may allow you to buy a six-pack if it is permitted to be sold within a particular province. You need to ask and find out if the province carries Grimbergen. One can also order it online using the same criteria.

In fact, it's the basis of many popular alcoholic beverages, like and &quot;egg nog&quot; (which is a spirit, a whole egg, cream and simple syrup), or the White Russian (vodka and milk). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Milk or cream-based beverages can become curdled, but it requires a high level of acidity (e.g. lime juice) to be introduced prior to consumption.  It's why the &quot;cement mixer&quot; shot becomes curdled (the combination of cream in the &quot;Irish Cream&quot; and lime juice). If you are not familiar, do not try to drink a cement mixer &quot;shot&quot;, it is typically considered a really bad prank to pull on an unsuspecting victim. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement_Mixer_(drink)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even though butter milk is slightly more acidic than regular milk or creme, it's not enough to cause a reaction like curdling (unless you add the aforementioned high level of acid). Plus, milk already curds somewhat on its own in the stomach.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a popular myth that drinking buttermilk (or regular milk) prior to alcohol consumption has preventative benefits (i.e. &quot;hangover cure&quot;). However, there is no scientific evidence that supports the claim that drinking any type of milk (even buttermilk) before consuming alcohol does anything to stave off or reduce hangovers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Conversely, it is well known that alcohol consumption slows digestion and reduces absorption of nutrients, especially those found in milk. This is because the alcohol reduces the secretion of digestive enzymes, which are what breaks down food in the stomach, including milk proteins and sugars. Alcohol also increases acid levels in the stomach, but it doesn't typically cause major negative side effects, when consumed in moderation, unless there is already another medical factor present. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;High levels of milk or creams, followed by excessive alcohol intake can produce effects similar to lactose intolerance, because the milk sugars are not digested well and move into the intestines. Once excess sugars are in the intestines, the bacteria there consumes the sugars and produces large amounts of gas. High levels of sugar in the intestines also causes more-than-normal amounts of water to be drawn into the intestines...a.k.a. &quot;diarrhea&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As long as you aren't eating cheese curd sandwiches, made with flourless (i.e. all-cheese) cheese bread, with 5 slices of cheese and cheese soup, followed by high levels of alcohol, you should be fine.  Moderation with all things is the key.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note: If you are diabetic, you run the risk of much higher levels of milk sugars going into the intestines and should consult a physician, because prolonged sugars in the intestines and stomach can lead to gastritis or even ulcers." />

The only time that oxygen is beneficial is when your must or wort (IDK the currect term for unfermented mead) has cooled and you are ready to pitch the yeast. Oxygen at this point will help the yeast to multiply. But when the liquid is hot prior to cooling, and after fermentation is complete, you should be careful to minimize the amount of oxygen you are adding to it. Always stir gently and avoid splashing when racking and bottling. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You use the word &quot;skunking&quot; in the title. True skunking (as opposed to staling or oxidation) is caused by a chemical reaction between hop extract and light. If you are adding hops to any meads, be sure to protect the bottles from light by storing them in a dark place, preferably in a box. Sunlight and florescent lights are particularly harmful." />

Text="The explication to your question is multi-faceted and not so easy to understand if one is neither Roman Catholic nor understanding of the nuances of religious life (Trappist). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The [Trappists][1] were founded in 1664 as a branch of the Benedictine Order at the La Trappe Abbey. The abbot of La Trappe has a greater authority of jurisdiction than the other trappist abbots. Under canon law this is permitted because La Trappe is the motherhouse of the Trappist Order. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The history of the Trappist Foundation in 1997 is of a totally different perspective. Originally only La Trappe Abbey could grant the title of the label to those [Trappist breweries][2] which could safeguard the integrity of the Order. All other monasteries which could not or would not abide to the conditions to be met, would not be granted the Trappist Label. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since 2012, four other Trappist monasteries have been added to the list, including St. Joseph's Abbey in Massachusetts, United States.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The three basic rules for granting the label are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The beer must be brewed within the monastery, by the monks or at least under the supervision of the monks.&#xD;&#xA; - The making of ales should be of a secondary importance to the monastery and should be seen as a witness of monastic life.&#xD;&#xA; - Any profits from the brewery are to be use to help sustain the monks in their life of prayer.

Since abbeys are independent of one another, sources of revenue are not limited to the brewing of ales. Some abbeys made vestments, while other distilled products such as kirsch, as was the case at Fontgombault Abbey from 1849-1905.

While I don't know of any clinical studies, gentian root has been used in herbal medicine for centuries to treat digestive issues. It makes sense from an evolutionary perspective because bitter compounds are mostly found in plants and are often more or less poisonous. If the body produces more digestive enzymes in response to bitter flavors, the extra enzymes can neutralize the poison or extract more nutrition from the plant material. It's certainly not totally effective, salivary enzymes won't save you from hemlock poisoning, but it could reduce the ill effects of mild poisons. " />

Good Wodka consists of extremely little impurities (a large part of it is just alcohol and water) and thus apparently is less likely to cause a hangover.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I found this to be true, provided the Wodka is of reasonable quality (Stolichnaya seemed to work well in this respect) and enough water is taken to avoid dehydration." />

In fact, if they give taste, they also give you hangover&#xD;&#xA; - The second, much more important is the fact that alcohol is diuretic. Once drunk, the alcohol is converted into several substances (in several steps) by your liver. The problem is once the last substances cannot be converted into anything useful, it will be ejected from your body. How ? By urinating. But urinating requires water. The problem is that if you do not drink water as much as needed, your body will take it from where it can, including from your brain. Now think about a sponge left without water inside and you'll have a good idea of what your brain looks like after a night, inducing hangover the next morning.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**To answer your question**, yes, Vodka is the most efficient alcohol to avoid hangover. But you can also avoid it by drink enough water while drinking alcohol (typically, if I'm at a party where I drink a lot of alcohol, I drink a pint of water after 2 or 3 beers)" />

But that is not exactly true.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You have single and double bocks with the same alcohol content.  Take Weihensthephaner for example (a respected 1000-year old monastic brewery): Weihenstephaner Korbinian is a double with 7.4% ABV. Weihenstephaner Vitus is a single bock with a higher ABV of 7.7%.  In this case, the single has a higher ABV than the double.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;More grains and more sugar do not equal more alcohol.  The strain of yeast and temperature determine the survivability.  Some yeast can live at high alcohol levels.  You can feed them all the sugar and grains and they will still die and stop fermentation (producing alcohol) when the alcohol level 'limit' is reached.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The eisbock gets a higher ABV by freezing the beer and removing ice.  This removal of water is how the alcohol content is increased.  Again, most yeast cannot reach 12% (which one typically finds in an eisbock).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The single, double, triple label has to do with the strength of the beer overall, including nutrition (calories) and taste.  Remember, these 'doppels' were created for sustenance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Careful with the word 'stronger' when talking about bocks.

First your body metabolizes the ethanol and then the fusel alcohols. That's why drinking alcohol helps against a hangover as if gives the body some more ethanol to work on and thus reduces the toxins of the fusel alcohols. That's why a Bloody Mary is a well known hangover cure.&#xD;&#xA;So try reducing the amount of fusel alcohols you consume by choosing high quality drinks that have less of them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another cause is dehydration and lack of electrolytes. So start hydrating yourself before, while and after you consume alcohol. And to keep the water in your body, make sure, you add enough electrolytes to bind the water. In russia and other slavic countrys there is a culture of eating salty (electrolytes and increasing thirst), sour (helps making you thirsty) and fatty (proteins and delays alcohol absorbtion) food along with drinking. In a way it's like having a hangover breakfast while drinking.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All of this can be done when you wake up with a hangover: drinking some alcohol as &quot;hair of the dog&quot; (this will reduce the symtoms but increase the time you feel them but won't fix anything!), eating a rich breakfast, drinking lots of water (tea, juice, ...) and maybe pop a blood-thinner like ASS (Aspirin).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusel_alcohol" />

You will learn how different foods affect the flavour of wines. It really does make a difference (you will be astonished). You will also (hopefully) learn how to analyse wines (without being pretentious) and make useful notes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2) Travel. Travel as much as you can and drink the local wines. If you find something that you really like and can afford to buy some, do so. You will never find your &quot;favourite wine&quot; by working your way systematically through your local wine shop.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3) Remember that wines change. One of the best wines that I ever tasted was a certain 1996 Amarone (Recioto della Valpolicella), and I was fortunate enough to be able to buy a case of it. However, once it was gone, it was gone. Later vintages (from the same producer) were not nearly as good.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4) Time passes. The wines that you love will be associated with treasured memories and inevitably belong to the past. You can never step into the same river twice. Such is the beauty of wine (and life)." />

The pint of Smithwick's is poured as normal, with a small amount of Guinness added at the very end, which sits on top of the pint giving it a head of stout. Adding too much Guinness at this stage will cause the beers to mix, and will ruin the pint.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Can't find a picture of it, but it will basically look like a pint of Smitwick's with a creamer (look and texture) head, and taste as such.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As a barman in a country pub for a couple of years during college, I had a couple of regulars who used to order it.

Text="Function&#xD;&#xA;--------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Beer glassware serves a few primary purposes:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - it is part of the branding of the beer (for beers with their own glass)&#xD;&#xA; - it presents the beer (beauty is in the eye of the beer holder) showcasing the beer's color, clarity and/or carbonation.&#xD;&#xA; - it influences how quickly volatiles (aromatics) are released&#xD;&#xA; - it influences how much beer can be consumed per sip (e.g. compare champagne flute vs. beer mug)&#xD;&#xA; - it can promote head retention (through the shape, plus small etchings in the base of the glass)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some examples&#xD;&#xA;-------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - A Pilsner glass is a long tall V-shaped glass.

Text="This is a simple question to ask but has a longer answer with a ton of complexities you probably don't care about if you are not brewing your own.  Ultimately sweet beers are part of the style they are in so avoiding sugary sweet beers is as simple as knowing the styles.  You can skip to the bottom if that's all you want to know.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are two types of sweetness that are often discussed and sometimes confused in beer, a Malty flavor and a Sweet flavor. The same ingredients are involved but in different ways.  Sugary sweet beers basically come from unfermented sugars which simply means sugars that the yeast hasn't processed to create alcohol and carbon dioxide.  This is also called attenuation.  Wikipedia has a good link for this but I can only post two links at the moment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This can be caused by a few different things such as unfermentable sugars that come from the way the beer is mashed (when the grains are mixed in with hot water and left to sit for a specific length of time) or from specialty grains, or the yeast itself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The explanation of how the mash affects sweetness is very complex and full of biochemistry.  I will try to summarize.  Grains are full of starches that need to be converted to sugar for the yeast to ferment.  There are two main enzymes involved in this process, alpha and beta amylase enzymes.  Using a branched tree analogy works great.  After a strong storm you need to clean up your yard from the limbs that have fallen from the trees.  You have a lopper (alpha amylase) which is great for cutting the branches apart from the limbs but still leave you with long branches and twigs.  You also have a chipper (beta amylase) which is good at taking the branches and twigs and cutting them into little pieces that are easy to use.  The two enzymes need to do their work together to make the most fermentable sugars out of the starches stored in the grains.  Alpha amylase is good at breaking the limbs apart into long starch chains but these are not easy for yeast to ferment.  Beta amylase is great at making small glucose chains that the yeast can convert but the big limbs are too big to get into the chipper, if the alpha amylase doesn't do its job first the beta amylase cant do its job well.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The kicker is each enzyme works in a specific temperature range (beta amylase 131-150°F and alpha amylase 154-162°F).  A brewer can manipulate the mash temperature to ensure both enzymes are working with an overlapping temperature (for instance 152°F) or adjust the temperature up or down to accentuate one enzyme over the other.  For instance if we mashed at 158°F the beta amylase will denature and not affect the beer, while the alpha amylase will be very happy and busy.  This will result in more long starch molecules in the beer which are harder for yeast to ferment and result in a sweeter beer!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unfermentable sugars can also come from specialty grains added to the beer for flavor and intentional sweetness.  The usual suspects are roasted grains where the sugars inside the grain will start to caramelize such as Dark caramel and roasted malts like Crystal 80, Crystal 120, Special B, Chocolate Malt, and Roast Barley.  Below is a great place for people to start learning the intricacies of brewing beer at home.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Increasing the Body](http://www.howtobrew.com/section4/chapter20-1.html)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ultimately these things are done by brewers to make their beer fit into the style they are trying to make along with other things like the amount and type of hops used and other adjuncts (stuff added to beer like fruit or rice or...)  So to avoid sugary beers you mainly need to know what styles are not sweet or its as simple as saying know what types of beers you like.  If you really want to learn the styles turn to the Beer Style Guide!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[2008 BJCP Style Guidelines](http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/catdex.php)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Look around and see which are sweet and avoid, meanwhile look for highly attenuated beers.  Id expect some you would like are:&#xD;&#xA;German Pilsners&#xD;&#xA;American Lagers and Pilsners&#xD;&#xA;Berliner-Style Weisse&#xD;&#xA;Dunkel Weizen/Dunkel Weissbier&#xD;&#xA;Munich Helles&#xD;&#xA;Belgian-Style Pale Strong Ale&#xD;&#xA;Pale Ales shouldn't be too sweet&#xD;&#xA;Kölsch&#xD;&#xA;IPAs should be dry&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;if you want to be adventurous try a Wood- and Barrel-Aged Sour Beer.

Let me suggest the mother of all pumpkin beers, **Avery's pumpKYn**.  I try to land a few bottles every year.  It is expensive, but it is not the type of beer one drinks several bottles of.  Each year, the ABV sits around 15 to 16 percent.  I like to say that this is the pumpkin beer that should end every other breweries' attempts to craft a pumpkin beer.  They should all stop and deem Avery the winner.  It is not just a little aroma of pumpkin, it is a mouthful of thanksgiving with each sip.  This beer is heavy and creamy and fills your nose with nutmeg and cinnamon.  Skip a meal for this one, it will fill your stomach.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you want to explore a wonderful variety of this brew.  I would suggest **Avery's RUMPKIN**, which is their pumpkin ale aged in rum barrels. This is a bit more of a kick in the mount though, as it not only get's a great deal of sweetness from the rum, it also gets a bit more alcohol too.  Rum barrel aging is a unique process.  So you get to try something that is likely new to you.  So often, brewers use other spirit and wine barrels, but you do not see as many use rum or tequila barrels.  Kudos to Avery for that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Both brews are priced around 10 bucks per 12oz bottle.  And you will need to shop at a specialty store for them.  I occasionally see them in Schnucks in Saint Louis though (which is a grocery store).  They are pretty rough when they are fresh.  So I like to grab a stock each year, then drink the ones I purchased the year before.  Age them upright at cellar temps, IN THE DARK.  I can not stress that enough.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hope you enjoy them." />

I tried your experiment of adding cigarette ashes into my coffee.  I have to say I was disappointed.  Besides seeing the happiness on the faces around me, I can't say it made any difference in the taste.  Now beer on the other hand may have a more profound taste change due to the ashes.  It really depends on the kind of beer and the type of ashes.   However, I do believe that if you like beer you might not even notice the ashes.  For example, if I'm looking into a beer glass and something is floating inside, I would be surprised to even notice it.  From the point of view of the ashes.  I can only surmise that they would prefer to go into an ash tray.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Answer: no, there is no change in taste in small amounts of ashes.  The more ashes you add to the beer the more of a scratchy texture but no difference in taste.  If you fill the whole beer with ashes you might find it milk shake like but bitter.

These hand pumps delivered about 25 to 30 pounds per square inch (psi).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Air is 78 percent nitrogen, so they were pumping beer that had a low level of carbonation with something that was mostly nitrogen.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The trouble with using air to pump beer is that the remaining 21 percent of air is mostly oxygen. If a keg is going to be consumed quickly, using air is okay. But if the beer is consumed over a period of more than one day, it quickly becomes oxidized. To avoid oxidation but duplicate the effects of traditional cask ale, modern pubs pump their low-carbonation draft ales with a mixture of 75 percent nitrogen and 25 percent carbon dioxide at high pressure, about 28 to 30 psi. Homebrewers can do this too, but using nitrogen is not as easy as CO2.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; It’s important to understand some basics. Nitrogen doesn’t behave like CO2. Nitrogen doesn’t have the affinity for going into&#xD;&#xA;solution like carbon dioxide does. Professional breweries “nitrogenate” their beer by chilling the beer to 32° F and forcing nitrogen into it under extremetly high pressure. Nitrogenation helps brewers re-create the smooth feel and thick head of cask ales. If you tried brewing a batch of homebrew, moving it into a keg, then pressurizing with nitrogen for a number of days, the only result would be a tap delivering very flat, high-pressure homebrew. As a safety note, most homebrew equipment is not designed to handle the pressure needed to force nitrogen into beer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Information for Nitrogen-Homebrews**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; First, make sure the beer recipes you want to dispense will be good at 55° F with low carbonation. The best candidates for this treatment are traditional stouts, porters, milds, and bitters.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Good hop flavor and aroma and the flavors from specialty grains are important in beers with low carbonation. If you have some of your favorite beer bottled, open one and let it sit for a couple of hours before drinking it. If it seems better that way, that recipe is a good candidate for a traditional English draft beer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; To be prepared for traditional serving, a beer must have a low level of carbonation. If you are adding priming sugar when kegging, cut the amount to one-third cup of corn sugar in five gallons of beer. If you are artificially carbonating, put the keg in the refrigerator, apply 20 psi CO2 pressure and give it a shake. The next day, take the keg out of the refrigerator, let it warm up to 55° F, and draw off some beer to check; there should be some carbonation, but not much. Stir the beer with a spoon and see if some CO2 bubbles are knocked out of solution.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; When you feel that the beer has the proper low level of carbonation, keep it at 55° F and reduce the CO2 pressure to 5 psi to maintain it. A stick-on strip thermometer on the keg is very helpful for checking the liquid temperature.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://byo.com/bock/item/1492-the-nitrogen-effect &quot;All block quote information is from byo.com&quot;" />

As a safety note, most homebrew equipment is not designed to handle the pressure needed to force nitrogen into beer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Information for Nitrogen-Homebrews**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; First, make sure the beer recipes you want to dispense will be good at 55° F with low carbonation. The best candidates for this treatment are traditional stouts, porters, milds, and bitters.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Good hop flavor and aroma and the flavors from specialty grains are important in beers with low carbonation. If you have some of your favorite beer bottled, open one and let it sit for a couple of hours before drinking it. If it seems better that way, that recipe is a good candidate for a traditional English draft beer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; To be prepared for traditional serving, a beer must have a low level of carbonation. If you are adding priming sugar when kegging, cut the amount to one-third cup of corn sugar in five gallons of beer. If you are artificially carbonating, put the keg in the refrigerator, apply 20 psi CO2 pressure and give it a shake. The next day, take the keg out of the refrigerator, let it warm up to 55° F, and draw off some beer to check; there should be some carbonation, but not much. Stir the beer with a spoon and see if some CO2 bubbles are knocked out of solution.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; When you feel that the beer has the proper low level of carbonation, keep it at 55° F and reduce the CO2 pressure to 5 psi to maintain it. A stick-on strip thermometer on the keg is very helpful for checking the liquid temperature.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://byo.com/bock/item/1492-the-nitrogen-effect &quot;All block quote information is from byo.com&quot;" />

It's also cheaper than oil, more shelf stable, and it's less concentrated which makes it easier to adjust how minty your hooch is. Just add it at the end when the kilju is finished and filtered.

In a keg system, long-term storage isn't a factor, and there's no appreciable difference.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In order to answer your question, a couple of things, first. 'Stay good'; is somewhat nebulous, but let's say that it consists of three things;&#xD;&#xA;1. Not being oxidized or lightstruck&#xD;&#xA;2. Not being infected&#xD;&#xA;3. Being pleasant to taste&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Point 1**: Oxidation can be minimized by using good brewing practices, which (if you're bartending) is kinda out of your control. If you're the brewer, that's different. But oxidative compounds can be in your hops or grain, so that may still be out of your control. &#xD;&#xA;Lightstruck is easy to avoid with good storage practices and brown bottles [- first google listing on beer cellaring] here, and it has good info.[1].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Point 2**: Beer isn't sterile. If it were sterile, it wouldn't be good. Pasteurization can make beer nearly sterile - so close that it pretty much *is* sterile - but pasteurized beer generally has a shorter shelf life than beer with the right active microbes. Case in point: a pasteurized pale american lager at 3 years vs. a non-pasteurized lambic at 3 years. Or a bottle of Brett-aged beer. Lambics and wild beers have tons of microbes. Microbes do good things for stability, long-term. Or bad things, if you have bad microbes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The reason they stay good and don't make you sick is that the yeast, lactobacilli, pediococcus et al, alter the Ph so that hostile microbes won't grow, which leads me to the finale of point 2:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Co2 in solution drives the Ph of the liquid down, or towards acidity. [Hard science paper about that here][2](although you can only read the preview without membership, there's a graph in the preview that shows the effect on atmospheres of dissolved Co2 vs Ph). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Point 3**:Being pleasant to taste. Although this could be considered subjective if we got into the flavor of N vs Co2, it really just hearks to point 1: no bad taste chemicals. Good storage and good brewing make for good beer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I looked all over for examples of nitrogenated beer that would be considered cellar-able. I didn't find any. Does this mean that Co2 is better for the health of your beer?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Not necessarily. In order for N to come out of solution, it needs nucleation sites, which are usually other N bubbles. Coming out of a tap, it has bubbles. With a widget, it also has bubbles, but I'd be concerned about the alcohol slowly degrading a widget, were I to store nitrogenated beer long-term. Plenty of science out there about degradation of plastic when exposed to chemicals.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, in the end, it's just preference - unless you're cellaring.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.thekitchn.com/build-a-home-beer-cellar-tapped-in-201850&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17811917" />

But for white wines we had a closed lid with way for the CO2 to escape easily. Sulfites will be blown out with an active fermentation so they are pretty useless while fermenting, but they need to be added as soon as fermentation is done.

But there are some underlying explanations to explain why.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Cabernet Sauvignon is built for ageing. It has very thick skin, high levels of acidity, and low sugar content. For ageing, tannins are good, acidity is good, and too much alcohol can be bad. The sugar in Cabernet Sauvignon has an alcohol potential of about 12.5%, against 14.5% for Merlot. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Tannins and acidity need time to soften, that is why a normal Cabernet wine from a respectable winery should need 2-4 years before it can be appreaciated, and reach its peak in 5-10 years. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The lifespan is shorter for lighter wines, for example in vintages where it rained a lot, the wine can be diluted and age a lot quicker. In these conditions the bottle may reach its peak in less than 3 years. This is also true for industrial wines who do not want to take risks and do not wait long enough for the grapes to mature, giving very light wines. If you look at Bordeaux wines, a 2010 tastes younger than a 2013. Because 2010 was hot and 2013 was very wet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Over the years, wineries have developed some techniques to push the ageing potential further:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  - **In the Vineyard**: Planting vines in higher density (going up to 10000 plants per hectare in the Medoc region), performing green harvests, using only old vines, to get more fruit concentration.&#xD;&#xA;  - **In the Wine Cellar**: Some techniques are used to extract the grapes and concentrate the wine even more. Pre-fermentation cold maceration has become a popular practice for example. Or some more extreme things exist, like reverse osmosis, which is used in some top Bordeaux Chateaux to extract water out of the wine. The less water there is, and the more dry matter it has, the more ageing potentiel it gets.&#xD;&#xA;  - **In the Ageing Cellar**: Top red wines all over the world are aged in new oak barrels during nearly 2 years. Oak adds new types of tannins and anti-oxydants to the wine. This increases ageing potential a lot.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Cabernet Sauvignon is especially famous for its affinity for Oak. The Oak softens the Cabernet tannins while adding more of its own extra soft tannin flavours. This way the bottle can be opened earlier than expected but also age until later than expected !&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All these techniques make the wine more complex, and enable it to age longer. These techniques also cost a lot of money.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some great Cabernet Sauvignon from the Bordeaux region should only be opened starting from 20 years after bottling, but will need around 40-50 years for their most complex aromas to show.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So in the end you got to know the techniques and terroir quality of the vineyard who produced your bottle, and the quality of the vintage. But that is usually reflected in the price of the bottle anyways.&#xD;&#xA;" />

In fact, I've had 20 year old cabs that were still so tannic, I don't think they would ever soften up.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From a winemaking perspective, usually I found that wines taste flat for several months after bottling. I think the introduction of Oxygen (not necessarily a bad thing) at bottling time alters the wine for a while, but with age things start to level out. For a high quality cab, I would wait a year after bottling for things to come around and you can taste full flavors. BUT, that doesn't really mean the wine is ready to drink. Usually several years after bottling cabs start to soften their tannins and become much more approachable. Not everyone likes that though, many people like a younger fruitier wine. YMMV. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is for wine that is stored in a temperature controlled environment and not on your kitchen counter. Heat makes the process speed up but not necessarily in a good way. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are no hard and fast rules about when you drink a wine. I would error on the side of drinking sooner than later because it's possible to get vinegar or a corked wine the longer you wait. If you have several bottles of the same wine.

Something with some semblance of flavour and quality, but not so good that you're wasting a good liquor by mixing it with beer. Come to think of it, this rule probably holds true when mixing with anything, although I tend to use fairly cheap whiskies for cocktails. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In terms of specific whiskies, you could go with something like a **Bulleit Bourbon** or a **Black Bush Irish Whisky**, and if those are too pricey you could down-grade to a **Wild Turkey** or **Crown Royal**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The beer you choose depends much more on your taste in beer, as the flavour of beer varies much more than does the flavour of whisky. In general, if you mix with a lighter, more generic beer the flavour of the whisky will be quite strong, whereas if you go with a stronger flavoured beer the whisky will be more subtle. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If it were me, I'd go the stronger route to mask the taste of the whisky, because when I drink a beer that's not really what I want to taste.

The same thing happens with Gallo and large wineries.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As to the answer to how they keep the same yeast the same year after year. You can essentially keep yeast forever by deep freezing it.

You take neutral spirits, add botanicals, and redistill. Anything that comes out of the still will be clear. Some absinthes at this point are finished, these will be called blanche (white) or sometime la bleue. The first absinthe available in Val-de-Travers (the birthplace of absinthe) after the [ban in Switzerland was lifted][1] was a blanche. That same bottling was the driving force behind making it legal in the United States [(interview of lawyer who fought the ban)][2]. It can be really good stuff. Any of these can be really easily colored.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Green Absinthe&#xD;&#xA;--------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Usually absinthe gets a second chance to mingle (macerate) with some herbs after it's sprung from the still, this style is known at verte. This is when it gets it's color, as well as some extra flavor and aroma. It's a more complex flavor. The color that the chlorophyll imparts is dull. If it's neon green there was [food coloring added][3] and some of these &quot;greener&quot; varieties are actually blanche at heart. Also of note is that sometimes these food colored types add sugar, to make it friendlier to less experienced drinkers (or to hide poor distillation technique as happens with vodka). There is at least [one non-green bottling][4] that I know of that is still macerated post distillation, but uses hibiscus which turns it red. Because of the lighter coloring of most naturally hued varieties, I'm confident that with die they could be changed to just about any color darker color like a blue or red. These methods of coloration don't make them any less of a true absinthe, they do use wormwood (and equally important, anise).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Czech Absinth (without the e)&#xD;&#xA;-----------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The most common non-green &quot;absinthe&quot; is so called Czech-style, also known as Bohemian style. These are [not rightly called absinthe][5] and are historically known for very low quality. Instead of distilling the botanicals in the alcohol, they are cold compounded. It's made either by mixing spirits, flavoring oils, and food coloring or by macerating the botanicals without distillation.

Text="Clear Absinthe&#xD;&#xA;--------------&#xD;&#xA;Absinthe is made much in the same way that many gins are.  You take neutral spirits, add botanicals (wormwood and anise), and re-distill.  Anything that comes out of the still will be clear.  Some absinthes at this point are finished, these will be called blanche (white) or sometime la bleue.  The first absinthe available in Val-de-Travers (the birthplace of absinthe) after the [ban in Switzerland was lifted][1] was a blanche.  That same bottling was the driving force behind making it legal in the United States [(interview of lawyer who fought the ban)][2].  It can be really good stuff.  Any of these can be really easily colored.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Green Absinthe&#xD;&#xA;--------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Usually absinthe gets a second chance to mingle (macerate) with some herbs after it's sprung from the still, this style is known at verte.  This is when it gets it's color, as well as some extra flavor and aroma. It's a more complex flavor.  The color that the chlorophyll imparts is dull.  If it's neon green there was [food coloring added][3] and some of these &quot;greener&quot; varieties are actually blanche at heart.  Also of note is that sometimes these food colored types add sugar, to make it friendlier to less experienced drinkers (or to hide poor distillation technique as happens with vodka).  There is at least [one non-green bottling][4] that I know of that is still macerated post distillation, but uses hibiscus which turns it red.  These methods of coloration don't make them any less of a true absinthe, they do use wormwood (and equally important, anise).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Czech Absinth (without the e)&#xD;&#xA;-----------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The most common non-green &quot;absinthe&quot; is so called Czech-style, also known as Bohemian style.  These are [not rightly called absinthe][5] and are historically known for very low quality.  Instead of distilling the botanicals in the alcohol, they are cold compounded.  It's made either by mixing spirits, flavoring oils, and food coloring or by macerating the botanicals without distillation.  Be wary of absinthes [much over 140 proof][6], as they are frequently Czech-style.  Do be aware that they're called Czech-style because that's where the style originated and where most of this variety still comes from, however the Czech Republic does have [good examples of absinthe][7].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/04/world/europe/rebirth-of-the-potion-that-made-valdetravers-famous.html&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.bevlaw.com/absintheinamerica/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://realabsinthe.blogspot.com/2011/06/what-makes-green-fairy-green.html&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://www.absinthes.com/absinthe-adnams-rouge-p935&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://wormwoodsociety.org/index.php/general-information-education-214/39-whats-wrong-with-bohemian-qstyleq-absinth&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: https://www.diffordsguide.com/encyclopedia/275/bws/absinthe-how-is-absinthe-made&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://www.praguepost.com/articles/2006/04/26/worthy-of-their-name.php" />

Eau-de-vie means different things in different places but, in France (where St. Germain hails from) it basically means any distillate. I'd venture to say, since St. Germain refuses to specify, that it's actually a blend of unaged fruit brandys. If this is the case, it almost certainly includes pear (who's distillate is pretty popular in France).... and if you mix grapes and strawberries (both grown in France) you can come close to something approximating lychee (which I doubt they would ship in). The addition of the elderflower would push the grape/strawberry even closer in that lychee direction. This is all just speculation, a whimsy to kick around over a cocktail. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Realistically, I'd pick up a bottle of high quality syrup (Monin is popular), and use that to replace the liqueur. You want to use less in the cocktail as it's sweeter, but it'll bear the brunt of the work.  You can add a cheap neutral vodka (like Smirnoff) to thin it out if you like. Don't use water to cut it, it'll change the mouthfeel and water down your cocktail. For further experimentation you can use a combination of pear brandy or schnapps (really anything clear and pear flavored) and vodka, I'd start with two parts vodka to one part pear. You'll want to mix the two because otherwise the pear will likely be too strong. Consider garnishing with an orange or lemon twist to replace the citrus in the St Germain. I wouldn't worry too much about the lychee side of things, it seems any options would run pricey. Yeah, your mix will be lacking something but, no matter what you do it won't be quite be the real McCoy.... let us know how it turns out. Cheers." />

White labs is the company just finished the study of the [yeast domestication tree][3], where they analyzed the DNA of several yeast used in fermentation and determined how they are related. I've seen Chris White the founder speak at a homebrew event and it was very interesting. He has a Phd in microbiology from the university of california and sells to all sorts of professional brewers, distillers, and wine makers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'll summarize the information from the references here, &#xD;&#xA;but the bottom line is that they store samples at very cold temperatures so it's metabolism is almost shutdown and it won't evolve.&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;1. Brewers isolate there yeast in slants or plates. These are the pure strain.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. The yeast that is isolated will be stored at a very cold temperature to remain dormant and unchanging. (-80 Celsius)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. When they need to recharge because their yeast has drifted they remove a small amount from storage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. Using petri dishes they will grow a small size they can verify is still good.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;5. With this small batch they will add to wort (what brewers call the sugary liquid that makes beer) and then make a large batch of yeast.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/1753/how-do-new-yeast-strains-happen &quot;Homebrew yeast discussion&quot;&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.whitelabs.com/resources/how-we-make-yeast&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.whitelabs.com/news/Cell-study-qa-troels-prahl" />
