It became fashionable, particularly among the ladies, to drink a lager &amp; lime (cordial), a quasi-beer cocktail. The men followed suit to a certain extent if only because the middling quality of lager available in this era benefited from a good dash of lime cordial. The popularity of a lager &amp; lime has waned but the consumption of straight lager has burgeoned in the last 30 years, quite possibly matching or overtaking that of beer in the UK."
